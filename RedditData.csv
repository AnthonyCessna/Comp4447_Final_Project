0,Mood changes,"I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder in December of last year. Was on meds from December to January of this year until I stopped taking them completely because I felt like I didn’t need them. And I didn’t (at least in my opinion), January-early may was alright. 

I was sad here and there but nothing really drastic. I was high functioning for the most part. 

Up until late may and early June. I was in the worse depression of my life, I attempted/ gotten close to 3 times in one day. I couldn’t sleep, I couldn’t eat, I could barley move and didn’t want to get out of bed at all. So I had to go back on my meds which have honestly helped me, I feel fine now compared to the past few days. 

But after all of this, I’ve just noticed how much my mood changes. I can be completely fine then I can make a drastic turn and start actively planning &amp; writing letters. 

Does anyone else go through this? Frequent mood changes?  It’s confusing &amp; scary how fast I change my mind about everything. If I get triggered or think to much I start to go down hill. I wish I wasn’t like this. I feel like I’m starting to become manic.",1654824710.0,0,1.0,1,0,v8wabq,t3
1,I just want to be normal again.,"I’ve been going through a tough time lately, this OCD of mine has completely taken over my life and nothing feels normal now. It’s almost as if I’m just living the same day over and over again. There’s nothing to look forward to. I have no real friends, no gf, and I’ve gained a substantial amount of weight these past few days. I just want everything to go back to normal. I’m tired of living like this. Sometimes I just wanna fall asleep and wake up somewhere better or maybe just never wake up. I have a therapist who I confide in but the last meeting I was supposed to have with her which I was really looking forward to since a lot had happened, she cancels and can’t meet with me. I’m in such a rough spot right now. Why won’t this end?!",1654824357.0,1,1.0,1,0,v8w68f,t3
2,I can't leave my room. Advice?,"I don't think I have depression? I don't wanna self-diagnose. But I'm not sure where I should put this post.

I feel like there's no point. Last month I didn't leave the house at all but things got better for 3 days. I dragged myself to pull myself together for my best friend's birthday celebration. After we hung out I sleepover and hung out with her for 2 days. Then went to my father's house. It all went downhill again. It's never been this bad. For the 4 days I've been here, I haven't left my room, and I haven't eaten. I feel nothing. I'm not angry, I'm not sad, I'm not happy. Just nothing, no motivation. It took everything out of me to act happy for just 3 days. I want nothing more than to be completely alone. 

Whenever I leave my room I like I need to run away, my heartbeat goes way up, I start to sweat, and I feel like I'm going insane. 

When my father's wife speaks to me I fidget with my hands and try my hardest to keep a straight face and not cry. Why? I have no idea, she's amazing but I just can't interact with her normally. I really want to, every time I make progress... I fuck it up and take 10 steps back. 

I'm a 14f. I feel WAY too young to feel the way I do. I haven't even started my life and I feel like I'm at the end. I've been incapable of talking about my feelings my entire life. The first and only time I vented to someone(made the mistake of trusting my school counselor), they sent me to a mental hospital. 

There's no real reason why I feel like this. My family loves me and does everything for me. I have amazing friends. I have everything I want. I'm conventionally attractive. I'm in the highest academic courses possible for my age. I have my feature set up for me. I have the life so many people work so hard to provide for their children. I have no responsibilities, I don't need to clean, I don't need to work, I don't need to cook, I don't have school since it's summer, I don't have siblings or pets, I've never had to do anything challenging, not even academically.

Yet, I'm sitting here being useless. Doing nothing this the opportunities I've been given. There is so much I wanna say but I can't tell anyone that would care since it would only drag them down. 

I'm sorry if you read that but thank you. If you have any advice on how I break out of this, I'd really appreciate it.",1654823820.0,0,1.0,1,0,v8w01i,t3
3,I hate my family,"Hi, I don’t know who to talk to but I’ve been having a bad life for a while. Ever since high school I’ve had bad anxiety which turned into depression and loneliness. Making friends was hard and now in my junior year of college, I still have no one, I can’t sleep and my grades are horrible. My family don’t help at all but make things worse, my sister is a colossal ass that thinks about know one but herself, all she does is nothing but spend everyone’s money and gives known back. And tonight after she breaks the tv, the same day that we get through paying 130 dollars to get it fixed from it not working, but her response is, “get it fixed again”, like I have money to fucking spend. She has been nothing but a living bill from from thousands in car payments to her stupid boyfriend asking for money from me and my mom. I don’t hate my mom but she won’t stop funding her or kick her out. I want to leave so badly but I don’t have enough money. I’m so frustrated and mad I just want to run on the highway and get hit by a truck. I’m currently in my car cause my anxiety and anger is raging.

6,Empty. Worn out. Full of regret.,"35 m. I’m not sure if this is depressed. I’m not sad, like in a normal way. Melancholy would be a close definition I have no reason to feel this way. I have a beautiful wife and we are trying for a baby, we have good jobs and a house together. Everything is amazing. 

I’m a shell of myself. I don’t get it. I have everything going for me. No reason I should feel this way. It’s been 2 years off and on..

It’s groundhog day. I goto work. I come home. I sleep. I wake up and do it all over again. I feel like I’m a puppeteer and my body is a marionette. I have no idea where the last 15 years of my life went and I don’t know what I’m supposed to do. No idea how to explain it. Been trying to be more health conscious, drink less, exercise, consume less caffeine, etc. Not helping. Still just going through the motions.

I’m snapping constantly. Sometimes on my wife. Nothing bad, just short, snappy comments that are not like me at all. 100% of the time she doesn’t deserve it. There’s always an excuse on my end. I’m tired from shift work or I have a migraine, which is honestly the reason why. My head is pounding all the time. I’ve been checked out, diagnosed with ocular migraines and they are getting more frequent. I have “scintillating scatoma” 3-5 times a week. 

Anyways. 

I’m starting a new job next month and I should be excited. Been interviewing for the position for 3 years. Trying to get on with the company full time for 15 years as a casual part timer working 44 hours a week no holidays/sick days. It’s taken it’s toll. 

I do feel like I’ve been putting emphasis on getting this job will make things better. After getting the call I was successful, I broke down. Not tears of joy, just…nothing. My wife was losing it with excitement.. Just so happy for me and I had to fake being excited. What the fuck is wrong with me??? I feel so guilty putting my wife through this. I know it breaks her heart. I talk to her and she’s understanding but I hold back alot. She doesn’t know how bad it gets.

Not even sure if this warrants a post here.

8,How to Help a Friend,"Hello. I have a fairly new friend that deals with chronic depression. I try to help as much as I can whether it be with distraction, comfort or advice. However, they are only so open about what they are dealing with and how to deal with it. They say they want to deal with it on their own but recently I can tell it’s too much even for them. I give them their space when they need it, but I do step in when I can tell it’s too much. They are slowly warming up to me little by little but they express to me the reason they deal with it on their own is due to trust issues. I don’t need to know the details of their past and will not pressure them for it but I would like to help as much as possible.

13,How to keep motivation overnight?,"Hey!

I'm battling depression for some years now, recently i was also diagnosed with social anxiety and agoraphobia (fear of open space). From November to January i was in psychiatric ward, which was pretty nice. Now i'm trying to better my life again.

One symptom is, of course, lack of motivation. But it's somehow interesting, because often in the evening, before going to bed, i'm totally motivated to do all the good things i learned. Then comes the morning and the usual unmotivated routine starts again.

It's so damn frustrating, because basically i know what to do...but come the new day, everything goes poof...

Maybe someone has a bit of advice how to keep the motivation overnight?

18,The Worst Part About Depression,"Is the endless, crushing numbness inside you which seems to take all the joy and light in your life and suck it into a bottomless black hole of misery and despair. Like a ponderous burden you carry it wherever you go and hope no one notices how much you suffer under its crushing weight. Sure, you smile and laugh at jokes - at a times, maybe even for a moment - you feel genuinely happy and content. But like a migraine it starts of small but then works its way into a torrential abyss that threatens to consume you and drag you down until you can't get back up again.

Oh if only personification could do it justice or begin to describe the feelings of inadequacy of loneliness; the sense of detachment, the feeling tragic futility to every action. How much you long to escape the inescapable  - the narrow confines of ones own mind and thoughts.

How I am tired. Weary. Totally exhausted from fighting this battle everyday when it takes all my strength just a reason to get out of bed every morning and wile away the hours until I can once again slip into the unrestful, if temporary, reprieve known as sleep.

And then there's the anger that mostly manifests in the form of self-loathing. The wretched disgust you feel when you look into the mirror and see the miserable thing looking back at you with dead eyes and a fire inside him that is barely burning anymore. And you look at the pictures of your younger self - so alive and youthful and happy - and wonder where it all went and long for that feeling of child-like innocence and wonder.

I'm terribly jaded by my experiences in life and feel a sense of guilt. And why? Why should I allow myself that when there are so many more people in much more wretched conditions who yet find reason to soldier on and can see the beauty and vividness in the world where I only see washed out colors.

But the very worse, of course, is never being able to share any of this. To suffer in indignant silence and pretend that everyone is okay. Knowing, that behind those pleasant demeanors and reassuring smiles, you know they don't want you to share that burden. They have enough on their own plates, thank you very much, without needing the sad sack unloading all of his problems.

So in his effort to hold onto some tether of what little remains of sense of grounding and writes a long, rambling descant on his feelings because in the anonymous vacuum of the internet, maybe, just maybe, someone can at least sympathize. And like a witch doctor, bleeding the humors, he can excise some of the bile that's poisoned his insides and find some sort of relief.",1654820465.0,2,1.0,1,0,v8uys4,t3

(Depression.) He proceeded to say “maybe it’s a you problem.” Then he left and came back 10 minutes later yelling about how he deserves better from me for helping me with school and that I’m so fucking lazy for failing. And calling me egotistical for insulting him and yelling at him to leave my room. And for “messing with him around dad” which we both do regardless of who’s there.

Or even candy wrappers with a little smiling mascot on them. I feel deep sadness when I throw them away because all I can imagine is that little character burning and being crushed in a landfill. Another example, I love cats, but I can’t even really enjoy their company or looking at photos of them because I just think of all of the ways massive amounts of other cats are suffering and dying all of the time.

23,My step parents are dying and I am at a loss.,"I recently found out that my step mother (who partially raised me) has cancer and will not survive outside of a years time according to the doctors despite any medical intervention. At the same time, maybe 2 days apart; I was told that my step father (also helped raise me) is losing his battle with various respiratory issues (COPD / Emphysema) as a result of a lifetime of smoking.

Both are terminal, but I guess in some ways we're all terminal.

I am not quite sure how to process these emotions. I am deeply saddened, yet I have become completely numb to everything. I no longer find joy in many things I used to love. I have often felt like crying randomly throughout the last several weeks and often without forethought. I worry that I will one day forget the sound of their voices, but I can't start recording them now. Its too late for that. I can go to work and take care of my family by ratcheting on the mask and pretending that everything is fine when I need to as to not upset anyone else, but at the end of the day I am beside myself trying to rationalize what the point of this existence even is. Why even seek closeness with others? Is this existence just everyone repeatedly setting themselves up to be devastated by loss? Why anything if everything is for nothing?

I have lost many others before, (Extended family and friends) but I always heard about their deaths after the fact. Now my siblings and I have to watch helplessly as 2 people we love dearly die in slow motion. I have heard the clichéd phrases about how you should never take anyone in your life for granted. I haven't and this makes the pain of it all even worse.

25,The term 'DDD',"It translates to 'grown-up children of dysfunctional families'. I thought it's interesting that such a term is commonly used in Poland and that the stress on environmental factors is in the label. Maybe there's something useful here.

'It's important to highlight that the terms DDA and DDD do not constitute a particular illness or disorder, and in no medical classification do we find descriptions of their symptoms. We are rather talking about a certain syndrome, in which experiences from the past have influenced personality and the behaviour of a given person. It's worth treating these as signposts of what a person raised in a dysfunctional family can witness and in what direction they can take psychotherapy.'

'If a child grows up in a dysfunctional family, in which there are incessant conflicts, inappropriate behaviour, or even various types of abuse, they lack good role models. This can cause them to adjust to these dysfunctional behaviours, and they will perceive them as normal when they grow up.'

'Examples of traumatic experiences:

Physical violence  
Sexual exploitation  
Emotional abuse  
Physical neglect  
Emotional neglect  
Witnessing violence  
Addiction of a family member  
A parent's mental illness  
Unemployment, emigration  
Single parenthood  
Parent spending time in prison'

'Ludzie z syndromem odrzucenia w dzieciństwie mają tendencję do postrzegania świata w sposób wyjątkowy.''People with the syndrome of abandonment in childhood have a tendency to perceive the world in an exceptional way'

Descriptions

'They don't know what being normal is  
They feel like everyone around them knows how to be functional, but they can't do it  
They don't know how to live without chaos or crisis  
They can find it difficult to complete tasks  
They judge themselves mercilessly  
They don't know how to relax and have fun  
They find relationships hard  
They react explosively to changes they have no control over  
They constantly seek permission  
They feel they're different and don't fit in with others  
They're either extremely responsible or extremely irresponsible  
They're loyal towards their family, even when faced with a lack of loyalty  
They cling to the lie that their families are functional  
They're impulsiveThey believe that by trying hard they can be loved'

'it doesn't matter if the dysfunction in the family was 'minor'. Its effects can be felt the same way. Children develop traits that they will need to confront later in life.'

'Skrót DDA (w rozwinięciu Dorosłe Dziecko Alkoholika) odnosi się do osób, wychowywanych w rodzinie, w której jeden lub obydwoje rodziców byli uzależnieni od alkoholu. W przypadku wystąpienia w rodzinie innych dysfunkcji jak brak jednego z rodziców, przemoc, uzależnienia, emigracja, wykorzystanie czy zaburzenia psychiczne któregoś z rodziców, przyjęto skrót DDD (w rozwinięciu Dorosłe Dziecko z Rodziny Dysfunkcyjnej). Dysfunkcja w rodzinie może być również związana z psychicznym opuszczeniem przez rodziców, chłodem emocjonalnym, nadopiekuńczością oraz nadmierną kontrolą'  
'The abbreviation DDA refers to people raised in a family in which one or both parents were addicted to alcohol. In the case of there being other dysfunctions in the family, like a lack of one parent, violence, addiction, emigration, abuse or mental illness of either parent, the term DDD was taken o. Dysfunction in the family might also be related to psychological abandonment by parents, emotional coldness, overprotectiveness as well as excessive control.'

26,not used to this type of depressive episode,"hi all.

i've been dealing with depression for about 8 years, and over time the severity has decreased to the point where in the last year i really did believe i overcame it (well, about as much as you can overcome a depressive disorder). i would still get bouts of depression, but nothing debilitating or lasting more than a few days. 

over the last few months, i've lost all motivation. it started off subtle, just finding it harder to keep up with school work (i have diagnosed ADHD as well, so i figured that was the cause), which then turned into to coming home from class and laying in bed all evening (i assumed i was just tired from my school day). i started to pull away from my roommates, who i was very close with beforehand, because i would just shut myself in my room as soon as i got home. the only person i had/have any desire to see consistently is my boyfriend. as of lately i've enjoyed seeing friends every so often, but any consistent contact feels so overwhelming. i've lost all snapchat streaks (i know, not a huge deal, but at my age it's still a big way to stay in contact with people) except two, because i just don't have the energy to respond to anyone, even longtime friends who i only kept in contact with through snapchat. and more recently, it's been impossible to keep up with self care. this is embarrassing to admit, but i struggle to shower consistently, or keep up with brushing my teeth, cleaning my room, doing the dishes, etc.. i don't even have motivation to eat consistently anymore, i just don't have the energy.

i've only realized today that i've been in a depressive episode for a while. this doesn't feel anything like the way my old depressive episodes would feel, back then i would feel the pain and sadness. i've been feeling a bit down this past week, but other than that i would say my overall emotions have been ok lately. the really big thing is just i don't have the motivation to care for myself, or nearly anything anymore. 

i feel stupid for not realizing this and trying to fix it earlier; it all just seemed to subtly build up to this point. i know how to deal with the sadness, but how can i fix several months worth of lost motivation and energy? at this point i feel like i'm just existing in a void, and perpetually waiting for something fulfilling that'll never come around. if anyone has pulled themselves out of something like this, i'd love to hear some tips. thank you in advance.",1654818767.0,0,1.0,3,0,v8uf29,t3

I guess I just dont really have any motivation anymore. As a kid I always thought growing up would be fun, but turns out its not. I just wish I could go back to the days when my parents would cook me food and id be so excited cus they let me watch cartoons while I ate. Idk something like that.

I also miss how wholesome relationships would be. Id invite my friends over and wed play with legos for hours. Nowadays I always feel like whenever Im around my friends I pretend to be someone else. All the stuff we talk about and do is stuff I know is wrong but I do them anyway bcs I just dont care IF we ""get caught"" and its the only thing that can distract me from life if even for just a second.

My parents still love me but when we talk we almost always end up fighting. I guess thats another thing I miss about my childhood, always being able to hug them after they yell at me and fixing everything just like that.

When I was little I would get so excited when summer break arrived. Well guess what, I just got off for the summer and the only thing i can think is that nothing really changes. Everything I do is only to pass time anyway so what does it matter? 

I was always so happy as a kid but now everything sucks. If this is all there is to life is it even worth living? 

I honestly dont even know if anyone will read this but I just needed to rant. I dont like where my life is headed but I also cant seem to care enough to do anything about it.

This was ideal for me since my family will live knowing I died to a medical illness and not suicide and it'd be easier to get over. But me being scared to die made me even angrier because the real reason I'm still alive is because I'm too much of a bitch to kill my self and I sobbed for what felt like an hour. I don't tell my family how I feel because they will just tell me to turn to God more and It isn't normal for a man of my age to cry so I just keep it to myself and it's hurting me more.

36,The lethal question - why?,"It’s what everything boils down to, and when it goes unanswered it becomes as dangerous as it is short.

Why?

I get up and go to work. Why?

Why bother? Do I need the money for something that makes me happy or just to continue existing? Does it make me happy to go to work?

Why go to work? Why?

I signed up for dating apps. Why?

Would meeting someone make me feel better? I doubt it. Honestly I am more worried I will drag them down into the dark pit of apathy and depression with me. Not that it matters as I get exactly zero matches in over a year on the platforms. It is a hard confirmation I already knew that I will inevitably perish alone.

So why even sign on to these dating apps? Why?

There are lots of things I should do. From the benign like buying new shoes so I can go for walks without feet hurting or just buying a new lamp for the kitchen. To bigger things like improving the garden and building a garage.

But I do none of it. Why should I? Why? None of it will make me feel happier. None of it magically improves life. So why bother. Why?

There is no answer to it because all the answers are; it makes no difference. It doesn’t matter. Life just grinds on until you are shadows and dust. Forgotten, useless and insignificant in death as it was in life.

I don’t see any reasons to do anything. It all bottoms out at why? And knowing that nothing changes, nobody cares and we all just drag our feet through the swamp of life until it drags us under.

The darker question that rises from under all the other why’s… should I just end it all on my own terms?

Why not?",1654817554.0,1,1.0,1,0,v8u0pd,t3
37,Sometimes I can't deal with the changes to life now.,"I often find myself remembering what life was like before March 2020. I was at a part time job with co workers I enjoyed hanging out with, I was studying at University I felt like I was more able to go and see all my friends. Nowadays I'm in a full time job and I rarely see any of my friends and I rarely have any kind of event to go to for meeting up with them and I don't have friendship groups as they've never really worked out for me so it's not like a group organised event is really a thing that happens for me.

But all of that has changed now, and yeah the Pandemic slowed down any chance of meet ups but I also think it inadvertantly caused things to happen that contributed to the fact I haven't even physically seen some of my friends in 3 years now. It really makes me upset and angry at the way things have gone, I feel like part of my life has been lost and mentally I feel like the last time I saw them is still fresh in my mind yet so much time has passed and so much has changed it makes me feel like crap and want to go back to that time.",1654817296.0,0,1.0,1,0,v8txo1,t3

I've been with my boyfriend for years and told him I'm sorry that happened you must have the wrong guy he got really mad got right in my face telling me i must be a rapist (i'm a woman) too and i should go kill myself. i stormed out crying my eyes out-took most of my meds-of course survived

now i'm getting no support and feel worse then ever people are telling me if i was serious i would have taken all of it, get over it, grow a thicker skin, etc. i feel worse then ever and so alone. i've been crying non-stop all day-nobody understands how much that hurt. i was suicidal before so that really triggered me but everyone including my mother is telling me i don't get to have an excuse. even worse telling me to stop the poor me act-these people are family. they came over to visit and saw me half asleep with pill bottles everywhere.  i'm no longer going to visit with them again.

51,How do I tell a therapist that I use sex to make myself feel better? Like how am I supposed to bring that up when I’m disgusted by it?,"Ever since I was young I have always wanted male attention. As soon as I was 18 and graduated high school I started sleeping around a lot. I have probably slept with around 25 men in the last eight or nine years. I had sex with three men one after another in one night when I was 20. How disgusting is that? Most of them I met on dating apps like pof and tinder. The others I met at bars. I have never really had a boyfriend. Flings? Yes. Boyfriend? No. I always have felt like I never belonged. I didn’t fit in that much at school or really anywhere. My family didn’t care for me either so I was alone almost all the time. My family is a bit judgmental and I accept people at face value. 


I think as the result of not having a proper relationship I turned to basically being a whore to get the male attention I’ve always wanted. I don’t even care for sex that much tbh. I like the closeness i guess. When it’s over I just go back to feeling lonely, sad and angry. I’m seriously surprised I don’t have a drug addiction or alcoholism. Basically live straight edge except with sex and cigarettes. 

I know I’m a slut and I feel so disgusted with myself. What man would want to have an actual meaningful relationship with someone like that? “How many men have you slept with?” “Oh like 25.” I have already had pregnancy scares like three times. 


I don’t want to keep living this way. It’s just that when I’m depressed, lonely or sad all I want is to be mess around with a guy. After the sex or when the guy leaves, I always cry. 


I want to go to therapy but they will probably think I’m a disgusting person. I went to the doctor last year because I thought I caught an std (thankfully it was something else) but I had to tell him how many men I had sex with. When I told him the number he was shaking his head at me. I could tell he was disgusted.


I want to be a nurse and settle down with a nice man. That’s all I have ever wanted. Is to be loved and accepted. Someone who I can love with all my heart and he loves me back.",1654814759.0,4,1.0,1,0,v8t2sc,t3
52,Hello darkness my old friend," A cycle that keeps repeating, dread and anxiety, failure and misery.

Even this journalling, which I usually start and don’t finish. Something is wrong, I can feel it. No, I know it.

Howdy, it’s been a long time and lots of things have happened, for better or for worse, yeah you know the answer. Gaming addiction paired with adverse and intense procrastination is really wonderful, isn’t it? 5 weeks to write an essay, and what brilliant mind decided to do it just the day before? of course, it’s yours truly :)

Has life been good? Yes it has, but a quote which goes like “Hard times create strong men. Strong men create good times. Good times create weak men. And, weak men create hard times” I’m at the good times create weak men chapter, but hey you can’t have highs if you don’t have the low! Unless you do drugs.

My past days have just been waking up, going onto Genshin impact and Valorant and lo and behold, the time machine! 4-5 hours has passed. wow isn’t that insane! So the guilt kicks in but I have time right.. it’s only 2pm, let's watch some educational/productive videos on youtube and then magically I’m watching gaming or random videos and discovered another interesting channel. I’m quite a youtube connoisseur if I say so myself.

Even the style of writing now, I’m breaking it into relatively small chunks for our environmentally inducing short attention spans. I’m kinda proud of writing this for some reason and this type of irony that I’m reverberating today seems like good content, I might post this. It would be interesting and productive if I do journalling daily and try and improve myself and this can keep me accountable, should I make a blog website or is that too old school. I guess these days it might be Reddit?

This is just for the future me to see how, what I feel now as I believe the lowest part of my 21 years is like, dang I’m old now, I mentally feel like 17 and I think the past 3 years with covid, none of my skill trees has levelled up, but at least I maxed out my being distracted skill, my alternate universe me should thank this current me. Yea I just patted my own back.

There is just so much I can talk about and keep a track of if I ever want to reminisce these dark days again. But I’m scared that the people I know might come across this and see how much of an idiot I am, but insert a cool quote about truth. I can’t put my finger on it, but I can sense the truth quote bubbling in the depth. who cares anyway. I can’t end this journal now, it’ll be a boring ending and since I want to share this, I can’t be too personal and write what I planned, dang. hmmm.

When I go to sleep, I curl up and think “I’m such an idiot and wasted today, again” I imagine pulling my heart out or stabbing a knife but that’s just selfish, instead of me dealing with the pain, I’ll just be sharing it to much more people and I can’t do that to my parents who work so hard and my little brothers who I love and are leading a bad example. I sometimes wish I can turn back time and do things right but who am I kidding, every day is a new fresh start and I still waste it knowing that. I had a thought experiment of if I win the lottery too. I would drop out and go into buying properties, renting them out and investing in safe stocks and starting a youtube channel but being humble. I would invest in mentors and teachers for speaking, developing good habits, traits and becoming a better person. Language tutors, sports and hobbies and of course for my family too so we can all grow together. My timetable would be packed but fun, it’s a nice thought.

Well, I opened up a bit more and that should suffice for an ending. It’s now 11pm and I am an idiot.",1654814398.0,1,1.0,1,0,v8syck,t3

She fails to realize why we, her children, ended up like this— all with mental issues.
I doubt jail is gonna help her be better, she needs therapy and I do not wish for her to go to jail.

If the cops arrest her or something, I will not hesitate to do whatever. This is one of the reasons why some victims of abuse don’t step forward to report. Some still want their abusive parents with mental issues free.",1654814094.0,0,1.0,2,0,v8sun8,t3

55,Trying to chase a dream i never had.trying to be sober to be happy to have a life.,"Since a very young age i wase depressed the first instaces of those feelings i remember them since i was 8 years old. I was sexually assaulted when i was 6, in an arab community where i couldn't tell my parents trying to keep my ""masculinity"". Since then ive never felt alright, like something is choking me every single second like something is always following me but i dont know what. I started using drugs when i was 14 then opiates gave me the first feeling of being alright and safe, it was my first experience of being normal and having myself back.

The first 3 years it got really better but then i was back to a very harder form of depression and the feeling of being worthless, still i managed to continue through the school while using daily. But the feelings never went away though i wasted 2 years extra. When i finished school i took two years where i went crazy on drugs, i was using 1000mgs of tramadol daily in addition to amphetamines, and sometimes morphine and H and living my life in techno clubs and raves.

then i tried to start university and start trying to get sober and going to rehab, ive tried everything from ssris and anti depressants to suboxone, nothing worked the depression never went away and even got me suicidal until i stopped all the meds. Later i started using 100 mgs of tramadol daily to boost me and i started working as a web developer and finishing my second year in university.

Until the beirut explosion came, i was not directly harmed but i saw the explosion happen infront of my own eyes i went to beirut to help and i saw everything from dead bodies to people who was left with nothing. I stopped everything and started a commune soup kitchen with mutual aid and support, while trying to push on with the revolution that was going on. But we couldnt do thing and after 4 months the revolution collapsed and with it my soup kitchen commune and my dreams. I went back home but with nothing left no hopes no aims. And since then im stuck in a vicious cycle of trying to get back to life and breaking down. Though im not using much drugs but i am not doing anything, i lost my work and everything is gone.

Now the days go on like nothing, i am trying to transfer my courses and continue out of lebanon but it is hard with my age(24) and those feelings are eating me up more everyday.

74,"i've given up, i just don't know how to stop","So i've been depressed for as long as i can remember. It's a whole combo of bs reasons, but my parents are well-off, and i used to be smart,and I somehow manipulated great, caring people into being my friends and my bf ; honestly compared to the rest of my family who face actual hardships, i don't deserve to be as self-pitying as i am. But i'm a selfish, self-centered bitch, so here i am, venting here, looking for comfort from people who actually deserve the help. 

I hate myself. I hated myself when i was a teen, which made me do truly horrible things. These days, I hate myself for what I did, and for being a freeloading drain on my family and friends' resources.   
There was a brief period, two years ago, where i was happy. I fell in love with someone new, and dreamt of poly relationships and kittens and therapy and a career. We could've been happy, i think. I hope. But he killed himself, and now i just feel empty. That spark of happiness is gone, and now all that's left is everything else, which fucking sucks. 

The world is shitty and keeps getting shittier. I'm an awful person. Joy doesn't last. I don't want a future. I don't want to get better. I just want it all to stop.  
But like most of you i don't want to hurt my family and friends, who deserve so much better than this awful grief I've felt myself. I'm scared my very depressed boyfriend would follow me. I'm scared of dying painfully like my lover. I'm scared of failing and having to face everyone afterwards. I'm scared. I'm a coward. I'm too lazy to live, and too lazy to fucking die.  
I spend my days fantasizing about a quick death that would look accidental, but i haven't found one yet. When i do, I hope I'm brave enough to do it, because i'm so tired of it all. 

TL, DR : I've already given up, i just don't know how to stop.

76,Got in a fight w/ my Mom (Just need to rant out),"I just had a haircut and lemme say, I hate getting hair cuts. Ive been trying to get a short cut (like ear length or shorter) for awhile now. My parents always disagreed and stuff, and after cutting my hair, she called me a disappointment/disgrace. I have stopped trying to.  


The haircut, she did a good job on it. It just, again, isn't what I wanted. I was holding back tears, sucking them up. My mom pays, and we get in the car. She knows Im upset and goes onto asking ""If I let you do whatever w/ your hair, what would you have got?"" And I go on to respond ""Probably shorter..."" This starts an argument. Im more upset (then mad) at her, while she is udderly pissed off at me. We stay silent as she takes me home.  


I apologize for not being the daughter they want, and not making her happy. I don't know if this made her upset or more pissed since I closed the door, and went inside. I come to my room, get the amount of money the haircut cost, to pay her back. I write a thank you and apology on it. A small one. I lay it on her desk, and now I'm here.  


Why do I want my haircut short? -For awhile, I've known that I'm non-binary (or demiboy). I told her about it, like a year ago, and she said she would try to use they/them pronouns for me, which quickly faded but I understand. My dad, doesn't accept. I've given up trying to convenience them to let me get my haircut short, knowing its not going to happen and they're only going to keep telling me ""Do it when your 18"" , ""Wait till your 18.""

84,"Fired from two jobs in a row, feeling incompetent","Not really sure where to post this in but this seems like a decent place to do so. I feel so incompetent and awful right now (I mean I feel like that often but that’s besides the point). I’ve been fired from two different restaurant jobs in the past month, which are pretty much my first jobs back from covid. I rode the unemployment wave for as long as I could and then after that was over I just did deliveries which isn’t really something you even can get fired from unless you royally fuck something up. I’m almost 30 years old, and I have a college degree in Communications which has never really served any purpose for me because it’s such a vague degree. 

I’m still working in restaurants because it’s the only thing I’ve got enough experience in (and it’s not rocket science) for people to call me for an interview. Every time I try to apply to any sort of social media type job I don’t even get called back (fair enough, I have no actual proven experience in social media), and when I apply to videography related jobs (which I do actually have experience in but not a ton, did a couple internships and worked for a media company once) they don’t call me either because I don’t have the experience to be a one (wo)man band which is what people seem to expect from videographers. So I work in restaurants. The money is good for how little hours you work and it’s pretty easy (stressful yes but still easy). 

Anyways I just started applying to wait tables again, and getting an interview is no issue but apparently I can’t keep the job. The first place I started back in was pretty shitty, lots of things I didn’t like that I won’t get into here, but I trained for two weeks and then she said it’s not a good fit. The manager was a micromanager perfectionist so I was a little sad and felt bad over being incompetent but I got over it fairly quickly thinking I will find something better. 

And I did find something better, an even more fine dining establishment (the first was fine dining but more so casual fine dining) owned by a popular chef in my area that is not yet open and training the opening team. I got hired on a phone interview which was a little weird but looked like they just wanted people in there to start training. I’ve been training for in total 6 days and today in the middle of it we all took a 15 minute break and I guess that’s when they started firing people because I also saw a girl leave with paperwork in her hand before me. They told me “it’s just not a good fit” with zero other information despite me asking if they could elaborate. So now this time with no clue why I was even fired, I can’t help but to kick myself while I’m down, feeling like I’ll never be good enough. Maybe it’s the universe telling me I have a college education and I can do more than be a server (no offense to servers, I feel like most of us do it as a means to something else though not many people are servers for the pure passion of it). But then I think how nobody else wants to hire me either and I have zero desire to work a 9-6 desk job, I would serve all day over that. I’m a creative at heart, I make short films and work on that as my passion projects and would ideally like to have a more creative type job but I also cannot stand doing any more production assistant work in the industry so I just serve and then make my own films. 

I’m looking at Indeed and applying to more server jobs asking myself why I’m even doing this and if I’ll just be fired from every place I work for, whether it’s a restaurant or not. I keep asking what it is about me, if I’m not smart enough or just don’t have a personality people like to work with or what. I am very social, I had already made friends at this place so I know that’s something managers maybe don’t like to see, they just want you to put your head down and work. I don’t know.

The only person that **supposedly** loves me is my mother. However, she has been the person that more damage did to me. Since I'm a kid, I remember how every night we had horrible fights every single day. How she neglected. She never was for me. She manipulates me a lot of times (idk the reason) and as a result, I couldn't live my own life. She has always been dishonest with me. I mean, I could go on but I think it's enough.

On the other side, I've been absolutely alone since the pandemic and it's killing me. And it's not like I can go back and see the people that **supposedly** were my friends. Because They are shit, that's why I distance myself from them. In fact, I know they are shit because they were like me. And now I'm all alone. 

 Because of the pandemic, uni in Argentina is still virtual, so I have no social interaction. Also, the activities I do in my life, are all alone. 

Also, as no one gives a shit about me, I feel worthless. No one respects me, women don't even want to change sights with me. 

 I tried, but I always got ignored or bored. I can't make a connection with someone else. It's like my own being is fundamentally wrong in every aspect and I'm sure about it. I realize this year how everything is fucked up in my mind. And now, I can't bear it. I cant. It's just too much to bear all alone. That's partly the reason I want to end my life.

97,Knowing it doesn't matter but still care,"I've come to realize life is short and it can end so suddenly you may die with regrets. I know my time is not infinite but somehow I still care way too much.

I wish I could stay this way in public. Late night is wben I watch Ted Talks and philosophical videos and get in the nihilistic mood. But when out in public, my brain is hardwired into thinking people are staring at me and judging me. And the worst part is I actually care.

I'll admit it. I have a plethora of problems I think about on a daily basis. I have social anxiety, I am overly sensitive, I am paranoid, I am prone to overthinking, I get easily overstimulated in public and they all keep me awake at night. I know I can't stay this way forever unless I want to die.

I want all my problems to disappear. And the quickest way perhaps is to stop giving a fuck. I want to live my life and enjoy it to the fullest. But I can't. And it is honestly devastating. I've tried so much to just stop this, but honestly I don't seem to be making any progress.

No friends, too anxious to find those I can connect with. I struggle to be an adult on a daily basis. It would be all fine if I just stop fucking comparing myself to others. Why are others so happy? Why do I keep myself from being happy? Every time someone would approach me and ask if I am alright, I would anxiously reply yes and wonder how long will it take before they know I'm not who I look. I've had people told me I was so nice and all but truthfully speaking, I do not think I'm kind in the slightest. Why do people think people who are socially awkward are nice people? That's why I started taking the asshole approach and now no one thinks I'm nice anymore. I put on a resting bitch face and no one ever dares to approach me now. But again, that's not who I am either. But who even am I? I.. don't understand myself. I am not a nice, quiet, and awkward snob. I am not a grumpy asshole either. But when people have expectations of me, I feel obliged to meet them.

Does my anxiety push people away? Do my fake laughs cause others to feel uncomfortable? I am so much of a people-pleaser and so much of a nihilist at the same time that I have internal emotional conflict all the time. I would be faking my laughs and socializing for people in one minute and then turn completely quiet and blank the next. I remember this girl thought I was so chatty because the first time I met her I was in the people-pleaser mood, the next time she met me I wondered how much of a freak she thought I was because I didn't say a word nor laugh at her jokes. Am I a freak?

I hate to say it, but I think people hate me because of how unstable I am, my mood swings like a pendulum and I am constantly switching from bubbly to anxious mode. Sometimes I would be positive and hilarious and sometimes I just stop because my mind decides to go ""Hey, man. Don't you think life is meaningless? You will die sooner or later, why even try?"" I am not making this up. Every time I would be genuinely enjoying life, my brain just creeps in and decides to give me existensial dread. Like why? I am my own worst enemy.

Do people think I'm weird? I am too scared to ask. But I am positive they do. Everyone has given me the weird look and tried to stay away from me. There are way quieter kids in my class and they'te doing just fine. People feel comfortable around them. But me though? If given a choice between staying with me and someone else, chances are they'll run away with someone else. I feel like I'm too awkward to be around. If someone tries to break the ice by asking me how I'm doing or random shit, I would answer it in the most awkward way humanity has witnessed. At first I wouldn't think much of it because I've accepted that I'm not very socially proficient. But then at night, my overthinking brain starts sorting out shit I've messed up during the day and oh my god before I know it it's 2am.

I don't even know what's wrong with me. Most of the time, I don't feel comfortable in my own skin. I wish I could accept myself for being this way, but I can't help but think people are judging me and thinking I'm weird and that I may end up lonely forever. I want to speak, but I just fail every time I do, so might as well stop speaking.

He’s been hearing voices and seeing stuff. He scared and we’ve set up appointments with a consular. 
When he was in middle school some kid gave him and his friends acid and I believe he’s been stuck in psychosis. That’s why he hears and see stuff, like figure or the room moving. 
He tells me he hates hearing “it’ll get better” but waiting is what’s killing him. 
He says he’s not going to stop taking the meds because he fighting but his mind is telling him to stop. That his mind has already given up.

106,Today's thoughts,"Once again, riding the black beast, hoping to one day either kill it or let it kill me.

I had a thought last night.  People say that the universe has good intentions and doing good things will get you good things back.  Books like *The Secret* and *Good Times, Good Vibes* paint these wonderful pictures about how simply being positive will make the world right for you.

This is garbage.

The universe has proven to me only one thing; it feeds on pain.  In my imagination, I had passed (oh, what joy!) and the women in my life were arranged before me.  These were the ones that had used me, saw me as something to give them an advantage, or simply as a paycheck.  These women had come to know me by simply being around me, and had learned that I was actually a pretty incredible person.  I am a loyal friend who will help you to bury the body.  I was (not lately) a rock for my friends and lovers to cling to, steady in a world ready to throw them off.  I have many things to offer.  I am a quality man, friend and person.

But they only started talking with me because they wanted something from me that wasn't true friendship or a romance.  In this scenario, I learned why they had all originally approached or talked to me, I could hear their thoughts as they saw me the first time.  Dishonesty is something that makes me drop you as a friend.  If I can't trust you, or feel that your words are just things you say to get me to do things, then I won't even look at you.

These women in the vision had learned this, far too late.  They had found that they had used a man that would have given them anything due to his generous spirit.  This spirit had been taken advantage of, again and again and again, by these girls.  In this afterlife, they learned sadness as one of the few people they could have had a real connection with, a decent person, the man they claim to actually want in their lives, wanted nothing more to do with them, forever.

In this afterlife, I blocked them from contact of any sort.  No spiritual messages, no glances, no conversation.  They were left with the terrible people they wanted in their lives, for eternity.  They cried and cried at the thought of eternity without the one person that could have made it all interesting and worth it.  Without a person that is real, generous and a value to know.

And I cried and cried at the loss of this contact, as crappy as it was for me, and cried at the life wasted being a thing to be used, a thing that only was there to give advantage or money.  I cried because this was all I could ever expect, any life I lived or world I was on.

That's the universe.  A cruel gamemaster that thrives on creating situations where the only result is sadness.  The universe needs tears to keep the gears lubricated.  Happiness is the rare, momentary, spot-of-sun-in-the-storm minority.  I think this only happens when the universe screws up.  Look how quick it moves to correct these 'good mistakes!'",1654800720.0,0,1.0,1,0,v8nwpa,t3

109,For so long I’ve been grieving for a life I missed out on. Now I’m 26 and a part of me wished I wasn’t here anymore.,"Trigger warning - this post contains sexual abuse. Also sorry it’s a long read. 

   When I (26F) was really little my mom met a random guy after work and they started talking and quickly liked one another. After a few months I believe the guy moved in with my brother, mom and I. Looking back at it now I have no damn clue what my mom was thinking. At the time my grandmother was living with us so I didn’t notice my moms bfs infatuation with me until my grandmother moved out. It all feels like a blur because my memories are not that great but I remember him touching me inappropriately at random times maybe I was like 6 or 7. I was so uncomfortable and there were so many time I wanted to tell my mom but I physically couldn’t I was so scared of him. Every single holiday my mom and him would drink until they’re drunk and fight with one another, knives all sorts where pulled out and that insinuated fear in me.
    
     The sexual abuse happened spontaneously but it seemed to get worse when I started high-school. We lived a bit far from the school and at the time I didn’t know how to take the Bus route. I’d dress up a little and I remember I used to wear lip gloss and be girly, my moms bf would have to drive me and I remember he would leave our street and pull over and wouldn’t drive unless I kissed him and I would refuse and start crying until he gave up. I begged and begged my mom to transfer me somewhere else so I don’t have to ride with him. I still didn’t speak up about the sa and I was transferred, I ended up traveling about an hour to school but I didn’t care. There were many more instances of him being inappropriate to me but I don’t want to go into detail.
       
     Looking back at it now I wished younger me would just fucking speak up. My mom and him separated for a while and we moved to another house and I was happy that he was gone but shortly after she let him move back in. When I tell you something inside of me kept pushing me to confess to my mom it was insane. 24/7 the only thing in my head was “You need to tell someone about him or he’ll do it again”. So after a while I told my mom about him and she denied his actions. I was speechless. I went back a few months after but this time I told  my brother and he was extremely mad and my moms bf had to leave immediately. My mom on the other hand kept denying what her bf did and accused me of lying. She then left with her bf and didn’t come home for a month. 
   
      I’ve never felt more unworthy or useless in my entire life. My own mother turned her back on me. I didn’t get to live a normal life or be a teenager. I didn’t get to enjoy my early 20’s because I was terrified of being around a man who I thought at any moment would molest me again. I had a guard up 24/7 all i wanted was to  be freed of him. He came out of my life but that scar will always be there and I always grieve and wish I could of just had a Normal life like everyone else. I don’t have a social life now or any friends and I don’t want to have to explain to people why I’m so depressed, why I have to live everyday with a parent who doesn’t give a shit about me. My sil would make jabs at me and insinuate I’m a loser because I have no social life or friends at 26 and that I’m home 24/7. But sometimes as much as I want to go out there and live I’m mentally drained. I don’t care who wants to make fun of me because no one knows what I’ve gone through.

The struggle to even respond to any conversation is real. Generally nothing is “wrong” I guess. I have three beautiful children, a loving husband. The amount of money I have in my account is trash and it always has been. I’ve always been broke. Im good at what I do thought, and I opened a business (renting a suite) from a loan I got. Some how, over half the loan went to bills and now my room isn’t even finished. Im extremely embarrassed at every client I have to say “please don’t judge my room.” 
Im struggling to get clients and that pressure is insane bc I’m going to have to pay weekly next month. Idk what the fuck I was thinking. Every time I walk by someone’s room that’s all done pretty my heart drops and I feel fucking worthless. A failure. I tried making reels and I hate the way my voice is and how I look on camera. I also hate socializing. I have only about 100 friends on Instagram and the pressure to interact and seem so fucking positive on my business account is just disgusting and I hate it. 

My friend didn’t have to but basically insisted that she split my $45 bill with me at dinner bc if not I would just be broke again. There were other people at the table and they kept asking her why she had a tab. It was her birthday…. Ugh I wanted to die. At this point I hated myself.

I haven’t been diagnosed with depression professionally, but I think it’s clear and evident that I am deeply depressed. I’ve got the title I’ve been working so hard for years to obtain in my position, but it felt nothing afterwards.

I have all these reasons to be happy about, which I am, but I don’t respond to it with any excitement or thrill like I used to:

- Promotion at work, New title
- Nearly making 100K/year now
- Purchased the car of my dream
- A new born baby
- My son doing well in school and proud of him.
- I have a beautiful wife
- My wife and kids makes a good family to me, we don’t fight much and I can’t ask for more.
- I have everything I need and don’t need more of anything.
- Haven’t been buying things like I used to, don’t have a terrible spending habit
- Don’t see a need for materials

These are just a few major things that I know I should be happy about in life. And yet, I still have these negative feelings:

- Feeling overwhelmed
- Sadness
- Tired
- Exhausted
- Fatigue
- No motivation
- Feeling hopelessness
- Lack of interests in things I used to enjoy
- I stopped playing video games
- I stopped working on my hobbies
- I just want to sleep all day
- I feel lazy majority of the time
- I get very sensitive emotionally
- Slacking off at work
- Find no joy in activities with my kids
- No sexual desire
- Wanting to break down and cry
- Sigh too much, sometimes out of nowhere
- Disinterested in other people
- Disinterested in conversation
- Disinterested in going to events
- Bought gym equipment to work out but never work out
- Not finding any new interests
- I have thoughts of leaving everything behind and start a new life.


What can I do to go back to the things I enjoy, to be happy and find motivation again? I know it’s there, I think about it, but why can’t I push myself to do it?

123,I don't even want friends,"I just spent another whole night just looking shit up like ""why I might not have friends,"" ""why does nobody like me,"" yadda yadda yadda and this morning I've come to the conclusion that I just want nothing to do with other people. If trying my best is never enough to socialize correctly and form actual bonds with people and to actually be liked by people, then I just don't want anything to do with anyone anymore. Fuck people dude. I'm 26. If there is something inherently wrong with me that makes people not like or respect me, if there is something inherently wrong with me that makes me uninteresting, then I just don't give a shit anymore. I'm not going to sit here and fight for a decent fucking life that nobody else has had to battle so hard for. Socializing comes so naturally to everyone and at this point I just don't give a fuck about self improvement in this area anymore. There is no indication of improvement and  I'm tired of it all. I spent a very long time in my life being absolutely resentful and hateful of ALL people in general because I was always excluded, judged, made fun of, and not respected or liked like everyone else is all because I guess I am weird and socially awkward, although I never once intended to be like that at all ever in my life. So to me I just can't win. People can go fuck themselves and they can go on and enjoy their stupid fucking relationships with other people because it's just not something I will ever earn for myself or have in my life. I will always be on the outside looking in and nobody will ever really like me. At this point how could I have form bonds with other people anyways? I literally have no love to offer others. No love whatsoever. I just look at people and find reasons to hate them, just like they seemingly did to me. Fuck them all. 

So fuck it, you know what I don't even want friends. I'm sitting here in my mother's house having moved back in because I got a DUI almost a year ago and I quit my job a few weeks ago due to not being able to cope with being around people. I couldn't cope with how well everyone else got along with each other. I couldn't cope with the feeling of being judged every time I answered the fucking phone to speak to a customer, just because I couldn't consistently do an appropriate small talk and have a good customer service voice. And I really, really couldn't cope' with having to watch all the suave motherfuckers in my office so easily flirt with and attract the ladies in the office. Fucking shit man I almost don't want to go outside or watch movies anymore. 

My meagre savings are dwindling, but I'm just going to go buy some weed and smoke the day away because nothing fucking matters and if I die on the streets homeless who really ever gives a fuck? It would have been my own doing and all anyone could really do is look at the situation and go what a pity...yes, a pity that I was ever born to begin with. Fuck all people. They can all act like all I need to do is heal and be happy and positive and emit love for others and dedicate myself to helping them and the community, but I do not trust them. I do not trust them to love and respect me in kind. I do not trust them whatsoever.

So, I got married five months ago. I didn't have any honeymoon phase and still don't feel anything toward anyone.

This is what makes me worried. Otherwise, I don't have any problem with this in a world full of suffering. Dysthymia makes me immune to all kinds of emotions, so negative emotions don't affect me at all.

However, I will have a kid soon, and I want to treat my condition before he arrives in this world. I want to feel that amazing moment and give him all the love I can and don't want my condition to be a barrier between my family.

128,I feel like a loser and failure who ruined his whole life because of a wrong decision," 

Hi everyone, currently I am a 2nd-year Computer engineering student. Till my 10th standard ( School) i was a good student ( academic wise i mean) and being from India, thus everyone including my teachers, parents, and relatives insisted me to do engineering as its the most common chosen stream for boys here is someone is above average/good in studies. But the thing was i always hated maths so much, that i got 85+ in all other subjects and 80 in science but 59/100 in maths, this is the reason i wanted to do commerce in my 11th and 12th grade and then do some degree like BBA ( Bachelor of Business Administration ) as i was always interested in this business sector, but then again as I told earlier everyone that i knew kept telling me anything other than engineering is not good for me, it will not give me high paying job,status etc and after hearing all this i agreed to what my parents &amp; relatives wanted and thought of doing engineering.

Though, instead of choosing the most common path to do engineering i chose something different, which i also came to know, after i completed my 10th standard, which is diploma/polytechnic in engineering. For those who don't know, diploma is a 3 year course which a student can opt for after completing 10th, then after completing it, can go for engineering course, which is reduced to 3 from 4 years, because diploma students spend 1 year extra doing diploma as diploma is of 3 years whereas 11th and 12th in school consists of 2 years, so students who do engineering after doing diploma, gets admission directly in 2nd year in engineering.

I have passed diploma in July 2021, however i did get backlogs in math,basic electronics, but i cleared them in online sem ( covid saved me), i wasn't able to understand maths taught to me in diploma, hence failed in 2 attempt, then did clear in online sem. Then after i completed my diploma, i had to look for colleges for engineering admission. I decided to take admission in a tier-3 engineering college here in India, so that fee is not much and academic pressure is also 'maybe' less. But again, my parents who always wish the best for me insisted me to take admission in one of the best private engineering colleges in India by taking education loan for half of the amount of total academic fee. I argued to take admission in that tier 3 college but they asked when you are getting an opportunity in best private college, why to settle for a average institute. I wasn't able to answer this and thought that doing engineering from a good college will make them happy as well. So, thinking all this, i opted to take admission in a very good college with huge building, great infrastructure and atmosphere.

I got admission in 3rd sem directly because of my diploma. But, here comes the sad part for me, in 3rd sem only 5/7 final exams were conducted in online mode due to covid ( which i did pass obviously) and only 2/7 in offline mode, which i merely did pass, 33 were the required marks to get pass, and i got 33.

Now comes the 4th sem starting Jan 2022, which took place in offline mode as there was no lockdown restrictions now. I attended my lectures,labs and workshops in college, but never really understood anything, i was feeling like only dumb student in my batch. Anyways, i did give my midsems and endsems, currently came back home due to summer break. I am depressed and stressed right now waiting for my result to come, in which i know, i am going to get fail in at least 4/7 majors, which i don't know will i ever be able to clear them in future. As, in my exams all questions consist of numerical and algorithms only, and i for some reason am never able to solve these numericals or even understand them.

I see my peers enjoying college life, studying one day before exams, getting good marks, whereas i sit blank in my exam hall, don't really enjoy college life, lost all my self confidence and self esteem. I don't like to/feel uncomfortable talking to people in my college, especially girls, fearing that they will definitely ask me about my grades.

I just keep on regretting that why did i make decision of doing engineering when i knew i am not good in maths. I keep wondering that how happy i would have been if i would have done some degree in commerce field instead of engineering. I am wasting my parents money, i am having a student education loan and i hate myself sometime searching 'Painless way to commit su\_ide"" on google. I am sorry, i wrote such a big thread, but at this time i don't really have anyone with whom i can share all this, so please kindly understand that, Thank You.",1654795309.0,1,1.0,1,0,v8lvwr,t3

130,"too young to hold on, too old to break free","The title of the thread is in tribute of the song ""Lover, You Should've Come Over"" by Jeff Buckley - it perfectly encapsulates how lost I feel in my adolescence.

I'm 26 and just started a software engineering job. I've never kissed or had any intimacy with anyone, and I am fully convinced I will never experience love. My friendships are volatile - and while I can make friends easily, they end up getting frustrated that I don't do anything about my situation, and cut me out for their own wellbeing. I half don't blame them either.  And even though on paper, I have a degree and a job, I do nothing at my job (most days I literally wake up at noon and play Valorant till my head aches), I never exercise, I don't nurture any of my skills, I don't read, and I don't date. I'm living a fraction of the life most people lead.

I'm functionally suicidal. And with people, I know how to act, how much to drink to curb social anxiety, and what to say to make people think I'm interesting and kind. But I'm selfish, helplessly codependent, too sensitive to what people think about me, obsessed with my own trauma and the narrative it presents, and very very disconnected from real experiences. Why bother experiencing anything when I can make up cooler stuff in my head that doesn't give me an aneurysm and cancer at the same time?

Like many posts here, I've been a target for bullying for a lot of my school life. And similar to my failures with women in that time, I felt sad about it but never really processed it properly. Now that I see everything in context, it makes me feel like I need to accept these things rather than to change them. It's like my mind views it as a genetic handicap akin to not having a leg and trying to walk anyway (apologies to those who really have this condition - I wish I thought differently about this). I believe that I am a worthless emotional burden, confidence-starved, dopamine-fucked, psychotically lazy, idealistic, stubborn, selfish, un-empathetic person who naturally gives off the incel stench. I am so ashamed of the way I victimise myself. I really feel like in the same way girls shut out men completely after a bad experience, I've shut out women romantically, even though the few glimpses of hope are a big reason to keep living. I can talk to them only in a friendly capacity but every time I like someone as a friend I feel myself drawn to them. So it ends up taking a lot of effort to manage these expectations all the time while also focusing on the other person in conversations. It's too overwhelming ultimately so I've gradually lost all my friends who are girls because I fear that I will fall in love and be a second away from bathing with a toaster.

I'm hopelessly addicted to weed for food and porn, and I'm addicted to using alcohol as a social aid to hide depression from people and make their nights with me memorable and comfortable. I have borderline personality disorder (mild I think, but it feels extreme nevertheless), ADHD, and a bunch of stuff that can't be recognised by the DSM.

But most of all, I don't know who I am. I don't know whether I'm empathetic or a sociopath, stupid or smart, a good or a bad friend, spiteful or loving, etc. I feel like I don't know what I care about anymore,  or whether I'm a good person or not. It feels like days just pass me by, and all I will remember from my 20s is the internal processing I've done on events in my 10s.

In terms of steps I've taken against this, I've quit weed as of 3 days ago, applied for my drivers license exam, recently gotten a job, and have been waking up earlier than my usual 3 pm. None of this progress makes me feel good about myself, even when I know it should. All I want is the love of someone who truly understands me and accepts me for who I am. But people leave before they get too close. Goes without saying, but I'm in suicidal ideation and I feel so disgusted and sad about who I've become.

I'm too young to sustain anything good in my life, and too old to act on any of my impulses. Too young to hold on, too old to break free.

To anyone reading this, if you don't care or you're in the same boat, just listen to the song ""Lover, You Should've Come Over"" and you'll feel the desperation for affection that Jeff Buckley sings with.

I started working out at 11 to fend off bullies and it worked. But then i stopped growing and everyone else towered over me so now i was not just ugly but also short af. So i always struggled with feelings of low self-esteem.

 I was also bullied for the shape of my head so now that im balding its completely exposed and so im short bald AND ugly. AND have a weird ass head. So u can imagine how i do with the ladies. Its not just that i dont get action. I literally get abuse.

One thing I always say is that as long as you have a big change in circumstances around the corner, suicide is not a good idea.  I mostly tell this to kids in high school or college students.  I stand by the logic; you don't know what existence in that next phase of life will be like.

I'm out of phases, now.  It's been a while since I was suicidal, but those thoughts have been coming back very strong over the last few days.  I know where my life goes from here, and it's all the same as I get older and more tired and more worn down.  I miss the spark of my youthful mood swings.  Everything is down, now.  Even when I stay positive and focus on the good things in life, I'm just talking about temporary relief from the negative feelings.  True joy or excitement doesn't exist anymore.

So, what do you say to someone who's tried it all?  I won't kill myself, because I know there are people who would be hurt too much.  I force myself to eat well, sleep, take my meds and supplements; but those things just ensure I'll be around longer.

It's all downhill from here.  I guess the only advice is to accept the misery and stop looking for a new source of hope, because that will only hurt you more.",1654788696.0,1,1.0,2,0,v8jfhh,t3

Apart from the panic attacks, the sleepless nights, the suicidal thoughts, the constant fear that everyone's going to leave me, and that something bad is just waiting to happen.

I keep trying to build these walls, to keep out the pain and anger and all this suffering, but I'm worried it's going to keep out love, friends, things I'd actually give a shit about. But maybe it's worth that sacrifice. Because it's easier to be alone, than to be hurt again. At least that's what I keep telling myself, keep convincing myself that I'm doing the right thing.

But all it's done is keep my emotions trapped, balled up inside me, trying to crush them down to be as small as possible, but that doesn't work. Because the more you push things down the more they can explode out. And when that happens, I can't control it, I can't control my emotions, and I don't know what's going to come out, sometimes it's fits of anger that feel so vicious. Or sadness that feels like it's drowning me.

But I don't know what else to do, and I keep telling myself that maybe this is what I deserve, maybe just maybe I'm not meant for anything else, anything better. I hate myself, but wants others to love me, and care for me, and I keep getting told that can't work, that I need to love myself first, before anyone else can truly love me. But this is still me, maybe broken, but it's still me, and if someone can't love or care for me when my mind is buried so deep in darkness, then can they ever really love or care for the real me, or can they only love the perfect picturesque version of me. Because I'm not that, and I'm worried I never will be.

And I'm worried I'll never be loved, never have friends that want to stay around, never feel ok, never want to be alive, never be peaceful in my own mind, never worth anything.",1654788689.0,0,1.0,2,0,v8jfel,t3

147,How something stupid I did as a kid cost me decades of my life and counting,"I (35M) will start from the stupid thing. Just a few years ago I could not talk about it nor write it down. There are other major problems in my life but this thing I'm about to tell you either started or amplified everything else.

Here it is: I used to throw my lunch sandwich in a stash near my home instead of eating it at school.

I don't remember why I didn't just eat it, there were several reasons. What I do remember is that I was afraid my parents (or my older brothers) would beat the shit out of me if I would show up with the sandwich uneaten. Beating me may seem like an extreme reaction. You should know that my family is large and moved from a rural area of a third world country to a western-ish country. Needless to say we had lots of problems adapting and beating your children was the only way to discipline them.

I remember the day I was caught as it was yesterday. I was eight at the time. I came home after playing outside and went to my room. Then my dad called me to the living room. A bag with all the sandwiches I threw over several months was on the table. All my family was there. I didn't even hear what they said. I thought I was about to die. They didn't beat me. It was worse. My mom said with tears in her eyes: ""Tell me you did not do it, tell me you did not do it."" I used to wish the'd just kill me there.

After all the scolding was done I went back to my room. I laid in my bed with a feeling that the world I knew is no longer there. For the next days my family barely spoke with me. My parents interacted with me mechanically. I felt like an unwelcome guest in someone else's home. I stayed outside for as much as I could. I was crying and thinking WTF am I supposed to do now?

Gradually they and I were back to normal but only on the surface. I was labelled as inherently bad and was the first to be blamed for anything bad. My parents told everyone they knew about this incidence. They told my nephews and my cousins. It was like a life lesson each kid in the family had to learn: ""Look at that horrible thing he has done, don't be like him."" I started to dread any situation that would bring up that incidence.

They didn't just shamed me for it. They were ashamed of me. They used it as an excuse to deny me of things and put me in my place whenever I did or didn't do something they wanted. At first I tried to stand up for myself. But they kept using that incidence from years ago to put me down. I did not have an answer to that. I believed that I was indeed a horrible person and grew to hate myself.

Trigger warning: **suicidal thoughts**.

I was depressed and anxious most of the time. I ended up losing all of my friends. I spent my teen years shut at home. I did not experience or learned any of the things teenagers usually do like partying or dating. I remained a kid while all my peers were growing up before my eyes. Outside of school activities I was completely isolated. I thought of killing myself almost every day since I didn't see the point of living.

I'm glad I didn't follow through with any of my plans. Can you imagine committing suicide for something this stupid? Anyway I have work to do so I'll continue later. Thanks for reading.",1654787169.0,5,1.0,4,0,v8ivg1,t3
148,What is wrong with me?,"I have a partner who loves me, I finished a decent college, I have an ok job, but still, I feel like hell all the time.

I've been an introvert all my life, I was that kid sitting in the back of the class and not interacting much. Because of my appearance, my colleagues often bullied me. The teachers didn't believe me and neither my parents, they thought I was the problem. I had good grades in school, but my parents never hesitated to criticize me when I didn't live up to certain standards. Sometimes they yelled at me, I argued with them. I was often compared to the smartest kid in the class. You know that kid, right? The one who got straight A's in everything. I was never on top, but I did well enough. For my parents, it wasn't enough, and that made me feel like I was a failure in society. 

I first fell in love in high school, but after a few years, my ex cheated on me. I felt horrible. I blamed myself for thinking I had done something wrong. I never learned the true reason of cheating. I was heartbroken, I cried every day, I couldn't concentrate anymore, I got quiet, every time I tried to discuss to someone, I started to cry. I thought then that I am ugly and no one will ever want me, no one will ever love me again. 

In college, I met my current partner. We love each other, sometimes we have arguments, but nothing serious. In college, my sadness began to worsen. I didn't like what I was doing anymore, but I couldn't give up because of my parents, they wouldn't have welcomed me home and I had nowhere else to go. I didn't know what else to do with my life. College felt like a chore after a while. With each failed exam, I felt worse and worse. I always cried in the morning, at noon and in the evening. I made a few friends, but I am not comfortable to share those personal things with them. I also went to a psychologist during college because I felt really bad. I couldn't find happiness in what I was doing. I left after the first meeting, she told me that it was all in my mind, that I was pretending and that I was begging for attention. I've never felt worse than that. I tried to read book about depression, anxiety, I tried what they were saying in those books, but it didn't worked. 

I developed anxiety, I can't talk in public, I am afraid I will make mistakes and people will laugh at me. I can't have a decent conversation with anyone, I have panic attacks when someone tells me ""we need to talk"" or ""what do we do now“. I don't know what to say or do. When someone talks to me I simply lost in conversation. It is like a cloud in my head. After two seconds I don't know what the subject was.
 
Fast forward, now I have a decent job, I stay with my partner, but I always feel awful. I wake up in the morning nauseous. I'm waiting for the day to pass faster, to get home and just stay in bed, to forget everything. I used to like to paint, but I can't find any motivation. I have a lot of books at home, but lately I haven't been able to enjoy reading them. My passion for reading books kinda vanished and I feel like I lost all my hope. I can't concentrate anymore. 
I often have irrational fears about family members and my partner dying, my brain making crazy scenarios about what would happen and I immediately start to cry. I don't want them to die. I don't know why am I thinking about those things.

I’m aware that those topics make some people feel uncomfortable because they don’t know how to express themselves thoroughly but he kind of shuts it down. Usually he’ll make me laugh and just hold me. But the past 2 days he’s felt different and kind of, far away. I’ll text him while I’m at work about how I feel but he leaves me in read. Or I mention it at home and he acts like he didn’t hear me. I just want to make sure I’m not pushing him away at all because of my depression.

159,A biography.,"TW: Self Harm

Depression is a funny beast. When its dormant, its just an aching presence in your soul that you carefully step around; praying you don’t wake it up. When its up, for me at least, there isn’t much hope. When I hit a low, its like there is a weight just sitting on my chest. Its impossible to move so I learn to breath shallow. And although depression is of the mind, I can tangibly feel the pressure and the toll it takes on my body.

Feeling sleepless, but sleeping more. Nauseous, but continuing to eat. Exhausted, but doing the bare minimum to survive.

Being a mother and a wife with the weight is its own feat. Its why I am so thankful I used to act. That person can move through the pain to provide. She can cook, clean, and take care of everyone else. That is her job and her burden to bear. I sit in the background, silently screaming and crying and thrashing at the horrendous pain my depression low causes.

It isn’t often these two people collide. I have gotten very good at keeping these people separate. 13 years of severe depression will do that. When I slip up and come through, I usually have two responses. First, panic attack. Crying, screaming, curled up in a ball in my dark closet. Second, cutting. For a while I got to say its been years since my last self harm. Now I’m back to square one.

The medication helped at first. It numbed the person I am and to keep me going through the motions. I haven’t done therapy. I want to, believe me. But I have to work. I have a child in therapy that comes first for all my sick time. I feel like putting myself in the back seat has been such a priority that I don’t even remember how to drive.

So where do I go from here? I guess only time will tell. But right now, in this very moment, I am silently drowning with nowhere to turn. Maybe this time ill let the water rush over me and find what’s at the bottom…",1654783003.0,0,1.0,2,0,v8hend,t3

And I was going on and on i’m the emails about how hurt I am. Then i just said I never want to speak to her again. We exchanged a few more emails and then nothing. Radio silence. Then I got anxious and emailed her something sexual. About how she’s missing out. More radio silence. Granted, she’s 6 hours ahead of me. In a different time zone. But, that was last night and there was plenty of time to respond by now. The way she constantly begs to be in my life and says that she misses me so much. Says that she doesn’t see a future with bunks but me. In love with me. We’re soulmates etc. She’s maintained this throughout the entire breakup and even now still. I thought she would have responded by now. None of it is okay. It’s unhealthy as fuck and i’m glad she possibly ghosted me. At the end of the day I know she’s no good. I just need help processing everything that’s happened in this short time. The mental breakdown. The anxiety, checking to see if she’s responded. The guilt for even talking to her in the first place. The anger. The disappointment in myself. I feel so stupid for even thinking about it. She’s hurt me more than anyone in my life has ever hurt me. I feel lower than low.

How is it, that those evil souls are able to be loved? 

On top of that, I lost my mom unexpectedly a few years ago. She was my support for this type of hurt. She was my advocate. I am so lost without her. I say that my dad and I died with her because we will never be the same.

I hate feeling bad or sorry for myself. But I feel like somebody has to… I just want to be a priority.

Reasons I’m not killing myself today:

-my brother, who has been depressed for almost two decades, would def kill himself 

-my sister is being blackmailed by her friends’ wife and needs my help 

-my best friend is in an abusive relationship and I’m supposed to help her move next week

-my other friend is on the verge of homelessness so she is gonna stay with me till the rest of the month, she is coming next week as well

-another friend of mine is a recovering alcoholic and I’m part of his support system and I would not want to trigger his alcoholism with that much grief

-my niece and my nephews could develop trauma due to my suicide because we are very close and I can’t EVER do that to them

-I promised 3 people I wouldn’t hurt myself




Where am I in all of this?  I used to have dreams and now I laugh when I think about those dreams. Become a lawyer? Working so hard in school all those years and then college I really thought that was going to be my key to “making it out” but now, I laugh bc I don’t even want to make it out anymore. I did so much work so I could get into law school. For what? Who is gonna be there for me while I try not to kill myself and simultaneously continue being there for everyone? Depressed, traumatized, terrified, hyper-vigilant, anxious, a heart condition, and endless diagnoses and medications and even surgery and an abortion and by my side I only had my ex-partner who is not even with me anymore.. 


It’s been so long since I have been able to hug someone and just cry. I just want someone to hug me. I want someone to hug me and let me cry without me being conscious of it and feeling guilty that I’m crying in front of them. I want to set down the glass. I want to lean on someone. I can’t continue being strong. I don’t want to. It’s not fucking worth it. 


I have put others above myself because of my trauma, because when you have to hold it together when you are 6 years old and your grandfather is raping you and continues to for 3 years but you can’t tell your mom because she was his princess just like you yourself were once your dad’s but then 13 years later a man breaks into your very first apartment 3 days after you move in and threatens to do the same thing your grandfather did and even though you protect yourself in that instance it triggers your childhood trauma so finally after all these years you tell your parents because your therapist and your siblings think it would help but your father yells at you and tells you even if it happened to never talk about it or tell your mom and when your mom tells you if you don’t tell her who did it then it never happened and then they later hold you hostage and take your passport away in a country you don’t want to be in and leave you to decay away in a room for almost a year and you finally make it out and then you supposedly get back your life but you get sick, you can’t process your trauma nor mask it anymore, YEARS of therapy &amp; medicine, even drugs alcohol love all the things that people think could somehow make them forget or live with their trauma when none of it works after years of trying .. is suicide not the only answer? When existing is a burden you can’t bear anymore why isn’t suicide seen as mercy? Why is it selfish? It’s selfish on the part of those who want you to continue to suffer while offering no support whatsoever but demanding you be there for them despite you being a living corpse?

Everything's going good except I have my moments where I overthink and shut him out. I did that recently. For like 4 days. And then I come back and we talk. And he decides I need to work on myself and get mentally better before I'm in any relationship. I panic like he's leaving me even though we aren't together. I start crying at work. Turns out he doesn't want things to change. Just my focus. Instead of on him, focus on me. I'm pretty sure I have bpd because he instantly became my favorite person and all I wanted was him talking to me and seeing me and when we aren't physically together I panic and make up all these scenarios. Like it's super late and I'm here thinking he's gonna have another girl in his room tomorrow morning. (Longer story there). Usually I 'joke' about him having other girls but it's a true fear. Anyways work sucks and I got talked to by hr because someone is stupid and if I were to act the way they are I would have been the one in trouble. So definitely double standard there and I hate that place. They're always picking on me specifically. Been trying to find another job but I can't. I lose focus. I dont see the point in finding one sometimes. Might as well just stay where I am. I don't like change. I'm going to have to be fired in order to leave that place. Going on 5 years there. So yeah Definitely had a break down yesterday and im not doing okay. Made an appointment with a psychiatrist (always had a fear if I was diagnosed with something mental My life would be over...ironic). The appointment isn't until 2 months from now. Idk how I'm going to survive if going on now seems like a daunting task. There's nothing that has made me low enough to not wanna be around anymore but I just feel that way.

194,If you have some spare time your opinions and thoughts would be appreciated,"Hey people of reddit, 

Firstly, I apologise for using a new account, I just couldn't bring myself to make this post with my real name as my handle. Id also like to mention that i posted this to r/ADHD, i am someone who has been diagnosed with ADHD and Depression, yay me. I have also chosen to post this here to see if any of my non ADHD friends could give some advice too.

To give a little back story, I'm 20 and from the UK. I was in my final year of college when lockdown started and never got the chance to finish my year, and was too on the edge to send myself to uni ( i didn't know how long we would be locked down for). I lost a lot of friends both before and during lockdown, day after day i would socially isolate myself more and more, to the point where i really only have one friend now. the excuse of not having to leave the house for a year lead to rapid weight gain, suicidal thoughts and many nights of staying up wondering how i could do this to myself, i had such bright prospects. I used video games as my best way to combat these thoughts, and it worked pretty well, as going into hyper focus with video games is my go to distraction from pretty much anything 

Fast forward 1 year from leaving college and i get my first real job, a sales role in a call centre, which surprisingly I loved, it is work from home and has flexible hours to fully suit me, as long as i meet my weekly requirement. 

I have now had this job for almost a year and a half, and every morning i wake up i have this instant dread of having to work, so much so that i get to the point of throwing up before most work days. I wouldn't say I am scared to work, something about me just struggles to do 9-4 with no lunch, constantly picking up the phone. It doesn't help that i work from my bedroom, as that is also where i spend my hours after work playing video games, i will spend 24 hours a day 7 days a week in here, with nothing to do outside. 

Now the simple answer would be to find a new job either in an office or in person, which i have managed to do plenty of times successfully, but getting to that interview stage is killing me almost every time, phone calls with prospective employers are great, but in person meetings are really freaking me out, I'm scared employers will see how much of a mess i am. 

Ironically i am really good at my job, and despite being socially inept, i have one of the best conversion rates for sales on my team, which leads on to my next issue. Sales wise i am excellent, but call management and time management wise i am a nightmare, i can have days that are glimpses of greatness, and weeks where i am the worst for taking a certain amount of calls in a day. We are massively measured on how many calls we take, how long they take, how long we spend not on the phone and even how long we are on the toilet for, to the exact second. This really gets me down, i can sell more than other team members but because they answer the phone more, or because they take one or two toilet breaks less they are always favoured. 

This has really put me off both working, and also day to day life, I am finding myself regularly thinking, 'what is the point' or 'why are you even doing this' and it will always spiral into the whole ' what is the point in being here if it is like this for the rest of my life?' and at that point the suicidal thoughts always creep in. This leads me to today. 

I have spent the last few hours genuinely weighing up my options with assisted suicide, and after a lot of long thought and consideration i realise i don't want to die, there is so much i have yet to see and do, and so many places i would love to visit, even though i am a complete loner and won't be able to share these experiences. However i also still feel like i cant go on like this anymore.

People of reddit, please give me your suggestions and opinions on how to combat this negative slum i have gotten myself into (please be honest no matter how brutal, wake up calls are always welcome).

197,My best friend suicide last week and I knew he was going to do it.,"I knew him during his best days, and by the pass of time I realize how he was fading down. I noticed quickly and I stayed with him, he open up with me, we laugh about it we have some fun, we had our philosophical retrospections, we share our sadness.

It really hits different because most people on this situations try to make depressive people no to feel sad and transmit some happiness…their intentions are good…but it doesn’t work like that. I knew that so I was 200% emphatic with him. He committed some mistakes and had a gloomy vision of reality, I always knew this was do to his depression so I never judge him, all I did was listen, gave him company when he wanted, talk, and gave him advices only when he want them. Do to this he really felt comfortable with me and shared with me everything. (that he want to share). I never gave him motivational talks and shit because I’m really sure he already got enough of it with his other friends and family. 

When he told me about his first attempts of suicide I didn’t try to convince him that life is good, etc because I knew he doesn’t feel it like that, I knew he felt like he was never going to be happy again and that it was unrepairable. I just stay calm and told him “ I’m glad you still alive with me, I love you, I like to be with you”. I never told him not to suicide, it’s a decision he already made, all I can do was to be there, listen, and let him know I love him.

He…he was really thankful with me…he told me that I have been his bigger emotional support and that he loves me…kind of like saying goodbye. “In case I don’t se you again”. I knew what that means, I knew he was going to do it…I just text him back, “Can you hold on  a little so I can see you for one more time?” 

I never stop him…I knew he was too stuck on that mind set that conventional shit like “there is more on life” “don’t suicide you still have more to live things will get better” was not going to make sense for him. Instead I just try to make his last moments enjoyable. 

3 days later I noticed I had a missed call from his mom…i knew it, he was finally resting in peace…and I didn’t had the chance to see him one more time, to hug him…and say goodbye.

I love you Yovanni, I’m calm you found peace in my being and I did everything that was in my hands, I’m now living for you.",1654764593.0,26,0.99,162,0,v8ce6g,t3

I went to college with my best friend from high school but I ended up dropping out due to school concentration and he followed soon after. I worked for a couple years and then decided to go back to school and get my degree in math and finished after 5 years. Anyways, Covid hit and I wasn’t sure what I wanted to do with my degree. I was working a low wage job for almost a year and I got a good job offer and passed the interview. 

I moved out from my parents house for the job and the job has been going very well and I have been getting a lot of praise for how well I have done in the 4 months. They are starting to put more on my plate and have not been telling me I’m still doing well and have been telling me I’m in the bottom 25% scores for managers and this has been extremely disheartening. 

I haven’t made any friends really since moving out and never been in a serious relationship and I’m about to turn 27.

I’m on 5 medications, my condition is very difficult to treat. Currently taking 1mg of clonazepam, 100mg of sertraline, 2.5mg of aripiprazole, 25mg of quetiapine, and 40mg propranolol. 

A few days ago I tried to workout (cumulative 45 mins, weights + cardio) but the effect was very jarring, I stopped. I’m not new to workouts, I’ve been doing this for 2 years now &amp; I enjoy it. But now I’m scared of doing it because my heart rate goes overdrive over the lightest trigger (120bpm even as I’m resting). 

I’m slated to have a blood test &amp; brain CT scan for any space-occupying lesions this saturday.

I’m wondering if any of you are in the same situation as I am and what happened when you continued anyway with the workouts.

211,Help,"First time poster, on anything about this. I have struggled with life for 4 decades. I have horrific PTSD, to the severity that when I start to open up in therapy, to ones who have heard the worst, they can't hold back tears. To have professionals cry when I barely scratch the surface of why I am so broken, it is discouraging. The one person I found that I felt was helping me make progress sadly died.

I have no close friends. None of the people I call family are blood related, and one distant blood relation has a new baby and older twins and I have never used them as a confidant anyway. Because of things that happened to me, it left me broken, but with a unique ability. I can go into any hellish crisis, help others and have even gotten people out of dangerous cults, without anyone getting hurt.

I fight so hard to be there for the few in my life, and the acquaintances I have all view me as their emotional rock, yet I literally have no humans that I can talk to. The past 10 days have been just awful. I feel like I am fading, and no one even sees or hears my cries for not help, just support. I haven't felt this worthless in 15 yrs and I am at a loss. My PTSD caused me to withdraw more and more from life, and now I feel like I am in the dark with no hope of ever finding light again.

I just feel so useless, and I am so tired. I live with 3 people and yet I live in total emotional isolation. I am probably not making sense, I apologize, I just haven't felt this awful for a long time. If just one person could please give me, not advice, but hope, I really need it.

I am imagining the man that I could become. It is truly someone I would love and adore. I can be that person! This is my fight. If I win this, I win it all. I want to be the hero in my own life and save myself.

My life has been difficult, from never really having a good family dynamic to begin with, my father tried his hardest to keep a roof over my siblings and I, to my father passing away from cancer only three years after I graduated from highschool, so having that transition to teenage hood to adult hood was difficult, can't believe it's already been four years since he passed. After he passed, it was my siblings and I, but they quickly became abusive both verbally and physically. My sister would pull my hair and beat me and threaten the cops if I ever retaliated, my brother was recovering from drugs and alcohol at the time and my sister quickly brought him back to drinking and my brother would barge into my room and choke me when he was drunk, they would always yell and tell me how pathetic I was and that I should kill myself. Now they're both doing a lot better for themselves since they found someone in their lives, my brother found a girlfriend (now wife who helped him with his struggles and she taught him how to drive and he lives in a house outside LA) my sister has the same thing going for her, she found several boyfriends to help her with her struggles and life goals (she's been going to gym and doing much better and learned to drive and is going to college to become a RN) despite being horrible people they found people to care and show them through their struggles in life.

Meanwhile during my struggle I was abused, my sister kept yelling at me ""your entire paycheck belongs to me"" ""you only go to college because I allowed you to"" even though she never helped me apply or anything like that and would constantly take food away from my hands and tell me I don't deserve to eat. It got so bad one time, late at night I got a butcher knife and wanted to stab my arm and probably bleed out but the blade was dull so I ended up taking sleeping pills and falling asleep. 

Now years later at the age of 26, I'm doing okay after years of struggle but the mental anguish I've been through has been a lot. It's only now that I've been saving up for a car, it's only now I've been going to the gym to improve my health and mental health, but even then I'm so alone, I haven't talked to any friends in months I have no family to talk to or support me in anything in life, I never been in a relationship. I've recently taken up drinking heavy amounts of vodka to cope, and taking antidepressants to cope. I feel like I must erase my pathetic life.

228,Why doesn’t anyone invite me anywhere and why have I been so empty lately?,"I just don’t get it.  Throughout the whole school year I tried my best to make more friends. 

My whole life I’ve been a generally shy person.  But going into my 8th grade year, I had gotten over that.  Still fairly reserved and definitely not outgoing by any means, but I won’t shy away from a conversation.

I had group of friends in class of five or six.  I got along with all of them and we talked daily.  I can’t remember a single time when I had a genuine argument with any one of them.  However, at my school, the popular/sporty kids are all one massive friend group and all of the friends in that group were apart of the larger group.

Also, at the end of the day, I suck at holding a conversation and eventually, they end up leaving to go and speak with someone else.

And as soon as school ended a month ago, I haven’t heard from them since.  But I’ve seen them around riding there bikes and going to baseball games.

And there was this girl I talked to just about everyday at lunch.  She was someone I could really talk to, because she could hold a conversation and let me make comments while she talked.  And for a while, I really liked her.  But then she told me of another guy she really liked.  After that, I started liking her less and less romantically by the day.  I don’t hate her by any means.  She is really one of my best friends.  One of the few people that have reached out to me over the summer.  But the problem is that for the longest time I never thought that I could like someone who liked me back.  And just when I was 99.9% sure she liked me, life throws another curveball.

Maybe they don’t want to associate with me because I like anime and watch it daily.  Maybe because they have the preconceived notion that all anime fans are cringy nerds.  I don’t know

Maybe because I don’t play sports year around.  I mean, I play sports every now and then.  Like track in the spring, I’m going to a tennis camp in a few weeks, and I might even do cross country this fall.  But I don’t make it my entire personally.  So maybe that’s it.

But it’s not like I have zero friends whatsoever.  My cousin, who has become my best friend over the course of middle school, and I have gone to a couple movies.  There’s usually at least one person on Xbox willing to play with me, but if invite them to play with me, I’m worried I’ll run out of things to say and they will leave or invite someone else and I will slowly be fazed out of the conversation.

And last, I constantly hear people saying things like, it’s not good to stay in your room and play games and watch anime all day.  But I don’t know what else to do.

So maybe I’m the issue, or I’m just missing something.  No one needs to respond to this if they don’t want to, it just feels nice to have something to vent to even if it just a bunch of people on the internet.😁",1654754017.0,0,0.81,3,0,v89xaf,t3

244,Disappointed,"I’ve been depressed ever since my family moved to a different state. My mom proved to me that she doesn’t actually care about me as she didn’t care if I finished school or not. The pandemic hit in my junior year and I pretty blew off all my classes mostly because of the poor communication. To top off failing my junior year we moved 1 month before the summer break. For more context, I went to the top high school in my home state, you had to apply to get in to it. I was super proud to be accepted and my family seemed so too, or so I thought. Like I said the pandemic hit and we moved. I now had to go into senior year with no friends and 4 extra classes on top of my already 8 classes (this new state has graduation requirements different from my home, they dont recognize my math credits). To top it off I found out the reason we moved, my brother failed 3 years of high school and was doing drugs (weed), so my mom decided that in order to save him we move to a different state. This really put the thought in my mind that she didn’t care that I was about to graduate from a prestigious school because she was so willing to move without a thought for me. Not only that I had a job that I absolutely loved, that got taken too. The final nail in the coffin was how easy my mom let me drop out of school. She rather me live paycheck to paycheck and give her rent money than support me going to school for a better education. She even judges the career I want to go into by saying stuff like “are you sure their are jobs for that?” She rather me work at walmart than go to college. I decided to get my GED which my mom didn’t even care. I finished it and applied to community college. I know she is secretly wanting my Fafsa to comeback with no support just so she can send me to work. The reason I’m writing this is because my friends graduated today and it hurts that i was 1 year from being alongside them. They all look so happy and proud to have finished and Im so disappointed in myself for getting my GED, i mean I didn’t even want to walk the stage because my friends would see that I got a GED instead of finishing school.

249,The Field,"TW: Suicide 


The field of grass where everyone goes. With the soccer posts and big tree. The place where memories were made. Where teens had their first kisses. Where kids scored their first goals. Who knew a simple field could mean a lot. The groups of old friends that come and go never to speak to each other again. The parents that ran around with their kids. That tree where I had memories. Now i stand at that field seeing all those memories i’ve developed over the years. With the moon above and the light posts giving off that orange light. I raise the gun to my head with tears flowing down. All the memories still playing around me. And i take the shot. All those memories stop. Silence around the field. And a body laying lifeless on the ground. A paper falls out of the body reading “i’m sorry 79.” I’m finally at peace. Thanks for the memories.



I wrote this story a while back and it still gets me to this day. 79 refers to a promise i made to at the time my best friend and the girl i loved for 4 years and never liked me back.

255,i feel i'm a parasite and i wish i could be so much more,"
This is a vent, not really a pity post or anything. I'd rather nobody apologize or anything, if this is even read at all. Basic info is I'm early 20s.



I just feel the world is against me and against me in every way and every direction. I try very hard to get better and keep going backwards.


For starters, I'm gay which many people view poorly. I have to be careful who I tell and can't even have basic friendships. I can't even have a normal relationship due to an unfortunate circumstance when I was under 18 and ended up getting HIV. I'm medicated but, people actively view me as parasitic and a hazard. I just wish this could be normal.



My past few years I've also been diagnosed with a series of things where if I got help sooner and knew what I had, maybe I could have been better or maybe I could have solved many issues in my life. Severe depression, severe anxiety, PTSD, paranoia and now it looks like it's autism and ADHD the past few days. If you have any of these, feel free to share what you feel about it yourself if you're comfortable, I recently got diagnosed with autism and ADHD.



My childhood hurts with alot of abuse mentally, physically, emotionally, psychologically and if I just had a friend, just one, things could have been better. I firmly believe this. Probably due to me being autistic and not really realizing what's right and wrong and missing social queues completely. I consider myself smart, but I make poor choices and can't really push forward. I want friends, but they don't want me as their friend. I feel generally unlikeable and people put up with me until they gain no benefit (advice, venting, money, etc.) I want to feel worth something.



And one thing that hurts me everyday is dental issues. I need root canals and teeth removed left and right and I'm only 20. Constant pain and need to spend 10 minutes extra making sure I can eat stuff carefully. This is due to genetics and also not being able to really brush my teeth. I was a shut in due to constant abuse in my life and couldn't really go out of my room because I never felt safe (and could also contribute to autism still figuring that part out with a psychiatrist.) Some days I had to pee in bottles, but I wasn't really allowed the freedom to brush my teeth twice a day. At night, if I woke up too early since I was curfew'd 8pm-5am, I would get screamed at and/or hit. Even if I had to use the restroom. Even if I needed to brush my teeth. 



I do want to kill myself, but I could never commit to it. I feel I have every right and reason to, but it's not worth it and I'm hopeful one day I can get better and one day things can change. I also struggle with money but again, maybe one day I can fix that too. I have to live in poverty income to get free health insurance.

If anyone is reading this, thank you for reading this. Again, it's a vent and I'm not looking for any pity or guilt from anyone. If you have anything to contribute, feel free to. There's alot of stuff I'm missing out and if you have any questions, I can answer. I'm exhausted and have nobody I could go to without killing my pride and showing how pathetic I feel and am.

Family life growing up, fine, alcoholic father blah blah blah everyone's heard it so so so many times. But I was fine, I was happy and okay. Usual gifted younger kid that did everything right turned into burnout, another common one that everyone has heard and knows well. I switched from in person high school to online in the middle of junior year as after a certain point I had set up a plan to kill myself rather than go to school the next week, so I wanted it to change before I got even worse and it did change. Did online school fine for months, aaand back to burnout. I dropped out of high school already. I tried working 2 jobs, got fired from both of them. I do nothing all day, I play games and loathe myself. I have a wonderful, supporting partner who has been with me for 2 years and I almost wish they didn't know about anything that's ever happened just so that they didn't have to feel bad or worry about me considering they have plenty to worry about as is. But i'm useless right now, I'm not getting an education because the past 2 years that i've tried ended up just making everything worse. I can't just push through it, I've tried. I don't know how else to start my life off. I'm only 16 but I feel hopeless. I've thought of several plans to kill myself as I have beyond enough items to go through with it but I've yet to even get near going through with one because I do not want to die, I want to be happy but everytime I try i can't get there. Oh, and, to top it all off i have the usual horrible self consciousness and junk. I've cut my face up a little once in my life and didn't regret it, but the difficulty of hiding it has prevented me from doing it again. Dental problems too, not enough money to get great dental care and all of my past dentists have just made it even worse considering i put so much work into my teeth and continuously get treated like I'm a lying little brat because they keep deteriorating. Friends don't support me, just tell me to get through it and when i say i can't get angry at me. I play games and listen to music, I have passions like singing, butterfly knife flipping, video editing, computer tech, i want to learn how to play more instruments more complicated than just a ukulele or ocarina. I have hopes still but I don't see a way i'll ever pursue those hobbies after 21. I have planned on killing myself no matter what at 21 since I was 13, I never saw a point in going further. I have never been diagnosed with anything as psychology diagnostics have also come up too expensive.

260,My cat denies me a stubbornly convicted death.,"I don't know what to say. Fuck it.  


TL;DR: Despite a lot of effective depression treatment, a shadow looms and a plague spreads in the west. I am too weak to fight and would rather fail than be captured, but my cat gives me reason to concede.

&amp;#x200B;

I will try to keep my thoughts concise.   
I have been depressed for ten years. My condition slowly worsened over time despite ongoing and varying levels of treatment from the start. I finally received TMS therapy recently, and it did help a lot. It felt like the river has changed directions in my favor; I am no longer swimming upstream.   


I hesitate to describe how I feel now, maybe relieved and tired, like I finally reached the top of the mountain with the boulder I pushed up. I can finally stop and take a look at the view and breathe. There is a stench in the air I can not seem to place. When I focus I see despair on the horizon. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am told my interests, ideas, beliefs and ideals are all incompatible with reality. I have focused so much on self-awareness and constructing a solid but repairable foundation for me to build this house. For so long I was trapped with self-hatred and confusion, so I chiseled away at my ego and personality to create art from this boulder I have been pushing. I created a statue standing with conviction. I feel like this was a mistake.

&amp;#x200B;

I am always internally angry, weirdly stubborn, and often defiant. On the other hand I am an empath, stupidly patient, and debilitatingly inquisitive. I remain openminded, I accept new data and create my opinions from there. I can be guided by emotion and logic. I have worked more than I thought possible on 'defining' subjective and objective. Here lies a tremendous issue with how I once tried to cope. I tried to 'cull' my subjectivity (beliefs, interests, etc.) for the sake of preserving the objective truths that didn't sit well with me. I believed doing so would grant me the ability to forgo my emotions and feelings to focus on pushing through life's artificial hardships. The culling only intensified my subjectivity, so I have come to learn.

&amp;#x200B;

Considering all of these things which I now know about myself and the realities which plague me, I do not see a way to participate in this existence without abusing my subjectivity. The only feasible scenario for an existence I can barely tolerate already seems out of touch to many. I fear there is no reconciliation between my subjectivity and some of the world's seemingly objective matters. I would like to see the sledgehammer they bring to try and tear down this foundation I made for myself. Pushing myself past my emotions to participate in a system which disagrees with everything I believe and value seems like a quick path to my life's two-week notice.   


99% of me says, ""Fuck this shit, fuck you, peace out"" and only 1% says, ""Do it for your cat.""   


I was recently allowed to discontinue an effective anxiety medication, with the option to use as needed. Yesterday, I peaked at 9.9 on the anxiety scale and I popped one back for the first time since I quit and it knocked me out 1.5 hours later. It's effects wore off earlier today. All of this panic and depressive spiraling, because I had to make an important decision that relied on this '99% fuck this, 1% cat' feeling I can not seem to throw away. I will feel absurdly distraught and dreadful the entire time I participate in these unagreeable activities and duties. I will not be healthy or stable.

&amp;#x200B;

I would much rather not suffer. I believe a lot of people can agree with a that statement. I am the obstacle in this equation, because the other side is immovable. I do not believe I have the strength to continue pushing this boulder-turned-statue around. I looked around and there was another peak to climb. My statue, my foundation, comes with me. If I chisel anymore, I lose parts of me. If I break this foundation, I will not feel safe staying in the house above. I do not think I would even make it out alive from a '1984' style 'corrections' facility. I would rather die with conviction than exist without my foundation. My cat is the only thing stopping me from running away to test these 200,000+ years of human evolution. If I do disappear, just know I ran away as my last option before ending my existence.

&amp;#x200B;

I now feel marginally better and more capable of tackling some trivial and sometimes menial aspects of my existence, yet I do not imagine this dread will disappear any time soon.

I would keep going, but for everyone's sanity I will stop here. I've been mostly lurking on reddit for nearly 11 years and I figured I would add my echo to the chamber.

I would point it on my chest, why? So my family won’t see me with a hole in my head. I feel like a failure. Maybe my therapist was wrong. He said I had a type of depression that only happens after certain events. Maybe it’s just bottled up depression that has slowly been poisoning me and the only cure for it is a bullet.

270,"I'm in the wrong place, but there is nowhere else to go","Forgive me for using this community as a sounding board,  a place to implode.  I have a history decades ago being treated for depression and this feels the same but I know that a great deal of what I'm feeling is caused by circumstances and events that I'm simply not able to manage any longer.  I'm suffocating.  I will make an appointment with my general practitioner hoping they will refer me to counseling or some other support.   This post is a selfish attempt on my part to see if venting to an impartial group helps.  Please forgive me 

I'm the family trouble shooter.  When something happens that requires another set of hands, a shoulder, a babysitter, a caregiver or just someone to be there I'm the first to be there the last to leave.  Very often my husband is there with me except in the circumstances where multiple situations are occurring at once and we divide and conquer.  We're retired, it just makes sense to call us.

Example when my daughter was deployed to Kuwait in January of 2020 she and her husband (a paramedic with insane hours) had a very well made plan for babysitters and such for her twin sons.   Then covid happened, daycare centers closed and my son in law's insane hours became unimaginably complicated.  We stayed as live in care for 7 months.

Then my father  was diagnosed with liver cancer.  His prognosis for treatment was good but my mother is in her 80s and has many age related health concerns herself.  We offered to help.  Packed our bags again and here we are.

A little over a month ago I called an ambulance for my father because of severe complications he has been in the hospital sense.

I have been there every day, 9-12 hours a day.  The first two weeks he was on a ventilator and I held his hand the whole time making decisions for him and my family that I have no right to make but there was no one else.  My mother refused to be at the hospital until he woke up.  My husband stayed home with her.

I'm 60 years old and so fucking tired.  I asked my mother to please let me involve my brothers to help.
She won't because it makes her uncomfortable to ask.  I love my parents, I do, but I can't do this alone anymore and I was devastated to learn that her embarrassment was more important than my exhaustion.   I know I'm being self centered.  I know she's in full denial of what's happening.  I still, for all that, know that I can't keep doing this.

He's improving some and she asked if I would be willing to continue his care when he comes home.  He is unable to walk unaided, has bathroom accidents,  has a gall bladder drain.   I absolutely will continue his care with the stipulation that she gets the family and at home health care involved as well.  She is now angry with me for even suggesting it.

Son, you think mami knows everything, but I don't. Sometimes, it seems like the only thing in this world that I'm sure of is how much I love you. When you fall asleep, I lie there awake and listen to you breathing. You are the reason why I keep trying every day, but I never want to put that pressure on you.  I never want to make you feel like a lifeline. My baby, you already saved me. All I want is for you to be able to have a good childhood and not worry about me. I want to see you happy, as you are now. Sometimes it's so hard to be strong for you. 

Mami gets sad sometimes, and mami gets scared sometimes. A lot, actually. It's okay when you get sad or scared, and no matter what, I will ALWAYS be here for you for whatever you need from me. You're everything I love and need in this world, and I'll never stop trying to get better. My sweet boy, in your 6 short years, you've taught me more than I feel I'll ever be able to teach you. I'm sorry if my illnesses have ever made you feel scared or insecure. I'm sorry if they have ever been a weight on your shoulders that you never should have had to carry.

285,struggling with lack of meaning in my life,"TL;DR: what do you all do when everything feels empty and dull and nothing feels exciting or worthwhile and you just sit inside all day? 

so a bit of background, i am 24 and have been unable to keep a job (the longest i had one was when I was 18 for about a year but i had to go to intensive outpatient a few months in because i got so burnt out/overwhelmed i could only tolerate a few foods and was very suicidal and depressed and having panic attacks all the time and hypomania and drinking and smoking and abusing my meds, i am much much much better now than i was then and have done a ton of work on myself, but i still just get kinda sad and aimless sometimes).

 i struggle to get outside of my apartment--i easily have sensory meltdowns or get afraid, i hate being perceived and i hate when people interact with me unexpectedly. 

i was taking one college class, an art class, after quitting my last job because of omicron, just to have something in my life, and i really loved it but still missed a couple classes because of struggling to go outside. i want to talk to the professor about internships she mentioned but i'm too anxious. i actually have some projects due friday and havent done them......i just cant get myself to care and cant think straight/focus

i just keep coming back to this thought of like, what am i doing with my life. i spend most days sitting around eating and watching tv. yea sometimes i make art or offer support to people online but like for the most part i just sit around being sad. i dont want to live this way, i want to make a change.

i've started waking up earlier, trying to get my life back on track. managing to at least wake up at 8:30 now but not getting out of bed really until 11. nothing to get out of bed for, nothing to look forward to.

i just like.....what do i even want in life. 

the worst part is, i had kinda had it figured out a bit. i wanted to work with kids. i'm good at it, i love it, it's perfect for me because i hate sitting at a desk, i love things that keep my attention in the moment, and with kids you can't ever zone out or someone gets hurt yknow. there's always some way to be creative, and problems to solve, and i LOVE that. but i can't do it anymore because they lifted the mask mandates everywhere and people have stopped caring about covid and my employer kept asking us to come in after being exposed. i can't live like that. i would rather give up my passion than contribute to this eugenicist bullshit when i have the option not to. fuck that. people's lives deserve to be protected from this virus and im not going to risk spreading it around just so i can coach sports or some shit even if i love it, even if the kids love it, just not worth it.

 also like, i don't even care if i find a career that i'm passionate about. i'm starting to get requests to walk dogs on rover and that should at least be some income (right now my parents support me since they know i struggle to hold a job and dont want me to like, die). but i view jobs as income, i don't associate my worth or life meaning with what i produce 

what i really care about is finding just ANYTHING that gives my life meaning. just anything that doesnt have me waking up every morning full of dread. i want to look forward to something. i havent looked forward to anything in a long ass time. nothing is exciting anymore. nothing is appealing. it all just feels empty, and i feel lost.

i'm sure i'll find something exciting eventually but idk rn im just. ugh. blah. everything feels dull and grey. and the negativity consuming my brain is not helping, the whole narrative of ""i'm horrible and selfish and unwanted and unloveable and a fuck up and a failure and pathetic and gross and i should be ashamed of everything about my waste of existence"" yknow. i feel like i need to justify my right to exist.",1654739817.0,0,1.0,3,0,v85u77,t3

Do I move on? I really don’t want to because I love her to death but I don’t wanna cling to false hope. We didn’t break up on bad terms and she is even letting me checkup through text once in awhile. She even said if I met someone new, just pursue them since it could be a long process. She even is trying to get a psychiatrist.  I got her to promise me that she will let me know if she wants to get back together before school starts. The bad part is I will see her everyday or be reminded of her.

304,Can’t move on from my dad,"My dad just moved back home after living on the other side of the country for the past couple of years—and now I’m just struggling to come to terms with the fact that he just doesn’t want the same kind of relationship that I do.

For context, he’s had a habit of blowing me off for a long time now: we used to have a weekly family call, but every time my brother was busy, my dad would cancel altogether instead of talk with just me. He visited last year and let me think he was an hour away working when he was actually just at my brothers house. He skipped my daughter’s birthday last year when he happened to be in town because he wanted to take a nap instead. When I have made plans with him it’s really just a coin toss wether he’ll cancel or not.

So I’ve been trying to focus on not setting myself up for disappointment. The last time he visited for a week, he stayed with my brother 15min away and I decided to just let him reach out if he wanted to—which he did once before he left. It’s definitely easier for me to not try and be ignored, than it is for me to cope with getting my hopes up again and again.

Now that he’s moved back, I’m still trying that strategy to let him reach out, but it’s still a struggle to not just ruminate on how disappointed I am that he doesn’t want to spend time with me. I’m hurt, I’m angry, and at the same time I’m lonely and eager to just run out the door if he does call. 

I look at my daughter now, who’s only three, and it’s hard for me to imagine not replying to her calls or invitations when she’s older. I can’t imagine only getting a week or two a year in the area and not wanting to see her right away. I had a really good relationship with my dad tho growing up, but it’s like he wanted _kids_ and now that I’m an adult he’s done with me.",1654734167.0,1,1.0,2,0,v841zx,t3

307,The relationship that changed me...," 

I (21M) was living my best live probably in 2019, I was super obese so I had got in good shape, I was going out and having good time and I worked through my low confidence of talking to people and become quite good at opening up to new people... I always sat down with new people and eventually became an ear for them to tell their problems to and feel good about!

2020 arrived, The Lockdown! While shutting down our colleges and me getting promoted to next year of my graduation made me super happy, I had a lot of free time due to that on my hand and I did the only thing there was to spend time freely, Social Media... Luckily got talking to some famous people and landed a Free lancing job with a Big youtuber!

I was very happy with all the attention I was getting (It was the only time in my life of 19 years at that point that I was getting so much attention) While moderating the streams for that youtuber I got started talking to this Girl and soon we hit it off, We started founding each others comments on YouTube and talking! Then we went onto chatting on Reddit then on Insta and very very later on in WhatsApp (Because initially she wasn't sure of giving a stranger her Insta ID let alone her number)

We started talking regularly from around 11pm to 2-3 am every night! I never used to stay up that late but now I did! I knew I liked talking to her and she also was being nice to me! Everything was going super well and I opened up to her all my secrets and depression of my life that I had never told to anyone in my life!

I asked her to be my gf in November 2020 (Almost after 3-4 months of everyday chatting) and she said yes! I was on the top of my world, She asked me just not to tell people about it and keep it a secret (I just thought she wasn't comfortable with dating a person she only have met online) We kept our chatting everyday... Some other guy from my team also started talking to her and it made me feel unsecure and I made it clear to her, It wasn't just him talking to her that bugged me but the fact that she started chatting with him in the time we usually chatted... This should have been a red flag but I was head over heels for her and just ignored it, She soon stopped chatting with him... I was relived but I didn't know it would only be for a short while...

She was somewhat introverted so to help her become more open I invited her to the Discord server of this Youtuber that I was the in-charge of and there she was getting a lot of attention and she made lots of new friends which I was initially happy about...

Around February she said she had exams and wouldn't be able to talk much to me... I very eagerly but patiently waited for her exams to get over but then she wanted to go to her relative's place and we didn't talk for a week for 2 even after that... I couldn't wait to talk to her again... While I was waiting for her to respond in those days I suddenly saw her chatting over at discord to her friends. I asked how she was and all (But talked to her only as a friend as she didn't want anyone to know, According to her first request)

We started chatting but she wasn't as much into it. Soon after she was less inclined on doing our personal chats and told me to join her and 'her' friends over the discord.. I thought nothing of it and did talk there but it was not that good, People over there was all Gaga over her and usually ignored me. Even she was too busy talking with others and barely talked with me... I didn't want to be the typical restrictive and controlling boyfriend and when she said she liked the group chats more than the personal ones I couldn't say much more...

That didn't stop there she started talking less and less to me while talking to these guys a lot.. She stopped seeing my private texts while she was chatting to them on the discord. She started playing group games with her while telling me to join there only and that she was managing her studies, her real life friends and these friends and didn't have that much time for our individual chats...

I was getting miserable day by day, The people on the discord didn't seem interested in me and just fought with me every time making me look like the Bad guy.. I tried and this one guy, Let's call him Virat becoming kinda like my best friend... He wouldn't support me on the group much but always said that I was right in the private DMs..

For some reason whatever I did, She just wasn't that much interested in talking to me... My cousins told me that it was Dead-end and that she had lost interest in me and to move on but I was so much in love with her! There was a time on new year she wanted me to flyover to her to celebrate it together and now she didn't even have time to look at my personal chats...

I was suspecting she was talking to someone else and I confronted her about this but she went furious and we had a fight for which I apologized for a week straight while she ignored me throughout... (Keep in mind she only ignored me while being active on the discord everyday) I was only sharing all of what was happening with Virat as that was kinda the only person I had left that was talking to me... Yes! She was so nice to talk to all my 'friends' just started talking only to her.

We started to have fights over discord thing and it would become a regular thing where she would say she will give me more time and stop talking there but it was all bs! The chats on the group died down soon after and I thought finally but she wasn't talking to me neither! (Later I got to know they made a separate discord server without me and talked there)

Sometime later in a fight she told me things that I only had told to Virat and I knew they both were on it... I confronted him with the screenshots of the texts that (let's call my gf Tanya) Tanya had sent me, I shared the screenshots of the chats between me and Tanya to him and confronted that he has been an unfaithful friend and that he was sharing things which I confided to him in! I told him I knew he was texting her behind my back... He claimed that he wasn't talking to her and that he hated her. But guess what? While I was still chatting to him, I got a text from Tanya mad that I send Virat 'Personal' conversation screenshots and that I had broken her faith and sense of privacy, I told her that she had lied to my face and that she was discussing the same things to Virat behind my back... She got angry and stormed offline.

I tried to tell her to let go and move on! Even apologized to her! She didn't talk to me for a week or 2... She had gotten into an Accident and she didn't reply to me in all that time, When we got around to chating a bit, I was worried for her as she was in hospital and I asked with genuine worry if she was okay.

She said she was considering some surgeries to cover the scars that she got, I was worried if she was badly injured but when I asked her, She ballooned the situation saying that I only cared about her looks and was worried that she was ugly now and she stopped responding... I texted her all night saying that, that is not what I meant and apologized and did everything to make her feel right... She again stopped talking to me for 2-3 weeks, While I was texting her in private she didn't respond and was happily chatting away to people in discord..

I was heartbroken... When she replied after 3 weeks of silence we had an fallout as I was mad because she told me she was very angry and didn't feel like talking to anyone but was very very happy to talk to people on discord... I asked how she had time for them and not me and... Long story short it spiraled into she blaming alot of things on me and making out it was my fault! Even mentioning that  
I had a temper and I even fought with her 'friends' online! That made me furious! Even in a fight between us, She defended and talked about the discord people she met after and through me!

She told me she didn't love me and this was a mistake and We broke up... I tried to keep the friendship because I had almost stopped going out while being with her, I anyways didn't have any real life friends and all the online friends I had made shunned me and sided with her... Basically my social life was over. The friendship was very namesake and she only ever texted back if I texted her first!

Soon after that I got Covid and the news broke out on discord and some people even reached out to me for appearances but she didn't... When I asked her about it later she said that Virat told her it wasn't a good idea talking to me and that leaving me alone would be better for ME!... The audacity of this guy telling her what she should do that would be best for me!

I was so pissed! That guy made my skin crawl and No joke but I wanted to go to this bastard's house and skin him alive! What made me alot more mad was This guy already had a girlfriend (She was also on the server) and I told his GF about the things he was doing and even sent her the screenshot as proof of Tanya telling me that Virat confessed to her about his feelings... Virat's Gf just shrugged it off. She was like this was a joke he was doing, He doesn't mean that and He didn't do anything wrong...

ARE YOU SERIOUS?! ""HE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG"" HE DIDN'T JUST RUINED THE LOVE OF MY LIFE? HE DIDN'T GASLIGHT PEOPLE BEHIND MY BACK AND MADE THEM BREAK THEIR FRIENDSHIP WITH ME? HE DIDN'T PRETEND TO BE MY BEST FRIEND WHILE DRIVING MY GF AWAY FROM ME? AND WORST OF ALL IS SHE THINKS HE WAS JOKING WHEN HE TOLD TANYA THAT HE HAD FEELINGS FOR HER!

I had severe panic attacks after that, I was feeling breathless with huge pain in my chest! The pain felt like I was having an heart attack! I was still suffering from Covid and this had me be on the verge of death as there were shortage of oxygen cylinders at the hospital I was in!!

I realized that the young confident guy in me who wanted to help everyone just died. For the first time I got the reality cheque of how the world is.. Tanya texted me awhile later as courtesy to just ask how I was (Probably the people in Discord told her to check after my panic attacks) I still wanted to remain friends after all of this! Yeah I was super stupid and I know! She told me she could never see me the same as before and it would be better if I got therapy and if I focused on my career... At that moment I was so almost done with my life, I just told her ""Have a Nice Life"" That sentence just came as a curse from the bottom of my heart...

That was all in May 2021, It's been a year, So many times I feel like texting her but I just then remember our final moments which kills me even more and I stop... Had many sleepless nights.. Started stress eating alot.. Gained almost everything I had lost before and more... Don't feel like going out, don't feel like talking to anyone. Moving out of bed seems like a battle in itself!

I became so numb to everything that I no longer laughed at funny videos, No longer felt bad for anything... I think about things surely but my face has probably not shown any emotion ever since...

Started to live separately away from my family... Still have no friends and I always wonder how easy it was for her, Her Discord friends and real life friends were there to support her even when she was wrong, She moved on from that so quickly! Almost felt like Evil won here!

While here I am still thinking about it even after a year all alone... I was an atheist before meeting her, She believed in God and Now I want to believe in god because He is the only one left for me and wonder if there is really any Justice there in his court... Because everyone who wronged me lived on more happily after that... The people over discord made other group they had the official group for the youtuber I worked for and everyone abandoned me... Everyone from there stopped talking to me and I am left all alone...

I look for solutions online on how to kill any leftover emotions I have... It's like I just want to be so numb to the point I am dead from inside! I don't even have money for therapy or anything... Literally my situation making me live through all of this alone...

Read somewhere ""God gives his Strongest soldiers the toughest battles"" don't know if his soldier in here even wants to live through this battle...

Any advice? Anyone who can be my pity friend? or You guys can be honest and just tell me to give up! Surrender and end it...",1654732293.0,0,1.0,3,0,v83g49,t3

309,I think I just had a breakdown a few moments ago and now I just feel hopeless,"I'm 13, which is the usual age people feel down, changes and all of that I have been told countless of times. Anyways, up until today I had a very positive outlook on life and had very good habits; I meditated, worked out, ate healthy, journaled, barely watched TV or played video-games and I was always happy.

I have this friend of mine who does gymnastics, she can jump around, balance and dance beautifully, just today at recess she showed me and a bucnh of other friends how she could do handwalks, and honestly I have never thought great things about gymnastics, all these people do it yet you never see any jacked gymnasts, only professionals are truly outstanding.

I made a bet and said I could learn how to handwalk in a week, and when I come home from school I try out, I practice, to start off I tried helping myself with a wall, and that's where I realized there isnt a single meter of wall in my home where there isnt any stuff or any trash.

My parents are hoarders, my whole house is a shithole and I have always known this was a real problem, but I was used to it, I didn't care, but  now, that an activity was interrupted by this  overcompulsive colection disorder, so I tried to make a change.

I had tried before to clean, but my parents would never let me, because things were ""expensive"", bullshit in my opinion. Because of that, this time I requested help from my mome and I kind of lied: ""Mom, someones coming in a week, please just help me better this place"" and she instantly got very defensive and skeptical, and ultimately she realized I was lying.

She told me to hang my clothes on my closet, and I told her that wouldn't do anything and that we should start throwing things out, she got even worse.

Things got out of control and I start threatening to cut a shirt, one I hadn't worn in ages, and my mom,  who by the way is obese, lunges at me and starts shouting and screaming. Thats where I realize the problem is out of my control, out of my reach, no one would ever come visit me, Id have no social life, it would all be shit because of something I can't change.

I start crying, and not just tears, but actually shouting in desperation while my mom is still screaming. Eventually I calm down enough to go downstairs and start doing homework, while going down, I felt my heart stop, I felt as if I couldn't move and I fell down the stairs, right after falling my heart starts beating like never before, it hurt.

Heres the worst of all, I don't know if my mother is retarded of something but she ran towards me and started hugging me as if I was a fucking teddy bear or something, all while she still was screaming. I tell her to let me go and she would not, I start screaming, my heart is getting worse. I start begging her to let me go and she still wouldnt oblige.

In an attempt to break free I push my back, all my weight, backwards, making my mom, who was sitting at the stairs with me hit her head, she starts screaming, now in agony though, like really high pitched and I run, I tried to run, because I had no energy on my legs at all, I ended up crashing into the couch downstairs.

I had a real bad fall, by the way, so now im laying down on the couch and all my body is hurting. I once again start crying, now not angry but just sad, I'm realizing my future wife, wont be able to meet my parents, and as so, I wont have a wife, I wont have kids, no legacy, Id be remembered by a select few as the funny guy from school, which meant nothing.

I start telling my mom all that and I think **thats** when she realized she was in the wrong. I can tell you this was also much more dramatic and much worse than I can describe. Anyways I just calmed dowm but I feel hopeless. If my biggest goal in life, having a family of my own is impossible, then what follows? I'm not working towards anything anymore, I'm just pleasing others.

I dont feel like doing anything now, like just giving up, but I know the more time that passes, the worse this whole situation will get, so I ask you for help. What should I do? Please give real advice and no ""it gets better"" bullshit, because while it may be true, its not letting me know how to get it to get better.

TLDR: My family is a bunch of hoarders and my house is in terrible conditions, I have no social life because of it and my parents never help, they just make it worse and I feel hopeless, every other endeavour in life is just to make others proud of me, not to achieve anything Id want now. 

Just now thing got to an all-time low and I feel emptiness more than anything, no want for anything, please give me advice before this gets worse and I get into self-hurt or other dangerous activities",1654733455.0,0,1.0,1,0,v83tmz,t3

311,I just don't even know where to start,"I'm in my mid 20s and I've essentially wasted my life. I've suffered from mental health issues for god knows how long at this point. But like the naive idiot I was I pushed it all down or thought I could just beat it myself, laughable really. High School was a disaster for me, it destroyed my soul. I learnt fuck all because I just went there since I had to, but I never really did any of the work or anything. I just breezed along like a idiot so obviously I didn't get into Uni. Whatever I never had any fucking ambition anyway. I never ever thought about what I wanted to do in life and honestly I don't want to do fucking anything career wise at this point I just don't care enough to slave away for a house/family or whatever. 

I had some friends when I was in my late teens/early 20s but I moved away with my family since I had no job and I had to leech off my parents which I'm still doing to this day. The thing is I hated going out a lot of the time because the ""circle"" I was a part of constantly teased and berated me. I'm not asking for pitty, fuck I used to like giving as much as I did, but at some point the constant feeling of being a freak got to much for me. I hated copping it from everyone but my friends doing it also was just to much. I don't think a lot of the people in said circle had any harm in their words I mean we were all just stupid kids. But once again my naivety kicked in and I thought I could just live without friendship, maybe it's because I fluked my way into every friend I made but I never appreciated friendship until it was far to late. I miss having friends so much, I have one online friend and I can't even really be honest with them since I'm so pathetic.

The worst part I think is I used to have a decent personality (at least I hope I did), I was a different person when I was out with my friends, funny quick witted and outgoing, but I'm just a shadow of that now and I hate it so much. I was a pretty smart guy but I've learnt zero and my brain feels like it's gone backwards if anything. Wasting away doing fuck all for about a decade has at least given me something, I desperately want to make friends and go out and actually enjoy life, I want to learn to ride motorbikes, travel the world and actually learn about whatever life is. And that's just scratching the surface.

The problem is I don't know where to start, I'm in chronic pain from doing zero exercise for years and bad health conditions. I think about reaching out to a Mental Health expert/therapist or whatever but I have no money and my parents aren't exactly rolling in cash plus I hate the idea of relying on them even more then I do now and I have a poor relationship with them since I pretty much locked myself away in a safety bubble. Then I think like is talking to someone about how worthless I truly am and have been for years really going to help me? I think about working but I have no skills or even a car. It's just to much for me to handle so I just shut down and continue wasting away. I don't want to commit suicide since I'm gutless and I can't hurt the few people who still have some kind of feelings towards me but I'm sick of going to sleep thinking maybe it would all be better if I just never woke up again.",1654733466.0,1,1.0,3,0,v83tro,t3

He calls me selfish, and that I try to control him. I said I wanted to die and he said well I can't stop you.

He resented me when I asked to talk. We haven't had a real convo in months. I wasn't even mad and I made that clear, I just was answering because he had complained that I never open up.

I was already at the point where the thing keeping me going was fear of pain/attempting but failing and ending up with severe damage. Really the only thing keeping me going now is the few routines I haven't given up. I feel totally numb, like a really miserable robot, and I'm not afraid anymore of the idea.

I am at the point where I've really considered the consequences, pros and cons....and realized it would actually genuinely be a net benefit to those I love. That was hard.

I guess I'm just venting because I have no one to talk to. I'm not asking anyone to fix the problems I have, I know most is self induced.

314,Someone please I need advice,"Hi I have had issues with my mental health since I was a teen. I’ve always kind of had severe ups and downs and I’m triggered by small things easily. Like a person cutting me off in traffic can set me off on a spiral that ruins my whole day and leaves me wondering if anything in life is worth it at the end of the day. Other days I’m good and can be positive and hopeful and almost euphoric from hearing a song or seeing the sun reflect off something beautifully or smell a scent in the breeze. I get overwhelmed thinking about the future and all of the challenges ahead. I’ve never been able to maintain a relationship for longer than a few months. Most jobs less than a year. I started using opioids and other drugs at a young age which spiraled me into a deep trench of addiction loneliness and hopelessness. Recently I have been better, I go to a methadone clinic which has helped with my addiction issues quite a bit and has allowed me to maintain a somewhat manageable life, but I’m still an addict though. Probably always will be. I can’t stand therapy or support groups. I always leave feeling worse and usually am triggered to use or at groups will meet people who I end up using with. Over the past few years I have become extremely isolated. The only social interaction I get is at work. Failed relationships and just general pessimism has led me to completely give up hope of ever having a soulmate or close friends ever. A lot of days I just wish I was dead. But then I pick myself up and keep trudging through the shit. Sometimes I think I want to try new hobbies or find a way to connect with other people but I lose hope quickly and return to my apartment or spend a week at my parents house laying in bet alone watching Netflix and eating junk food. I have been exercising more but probably not enough. Deep down I’m so lonely just dying to connect with someone but I’m so anxious and hard on myself for being awkward or weird and then I beat myself up both mentally and physically and give up trying. I’m so ashamed of who I am and about what I have failed to do. Some days I want to have goals and to love someone and be loved but other days I just want every single thought emotion feeling sensation and particle of my being to disappear or disintegrate or vaporize forever or to never have existed in the first place.

Fast forward later at 16:00. Right before being let out the teacher that caught me came up behind me and said something. I don’t remember what but she started rubbing my hips with her hands and on my inner thigh. I felt a sinking feeling in my stomach. I didn’t say anything or do anything. When I got home I told my mother what happened and she said “She was probably just being over friendly.” Right after that I explained to her that if the roles were reversed it would be a different story and walked up stairs. It hurt what she said. I imagined if my kid told me that. I’d go mental and ballistic. It reminded me to just never tell anyone anything what goes on in my life.,1654731521.0,0,1.0,2,0,v8378e,t3

But I have a girlfriend who loves me too much. Maybe I should have dumped her before we started doing distance, then I wouldn’t have to go through the unbearable pain of trying to be someone I am not and never will be.

I am a monster. I lack inhibition. I repeatedly lie, steal, cheat, and get intoxicated. My drug addiction runs so deep that it’s an inescapable aspect of my life. I’ve been using drugs as a source of happiness and numbing since my sophomore year of high school. I struggle to see any kind of light at the end of this miserable gray tunnel.

Why was my organism created to cling so hard to the instinct of life when all that life has brought me is anguish, confusion, and hatred? Am I being taught some kind of lesson for my past wrongdoings in another life? Curse the poignancy of being the center of your own universe.

322,I have never been worse than I am now.,"I have never been in a worse mental state than I am in now. Not even when I was 14, laying in a hospital bed after an attempt. I have no friends, no family, no one who loves me. All my friends talk to me when they need someone, when they need somewhere to go. The person I was in love with left me and I can feel him drifting further and further everyday.

 I finished high school and I dont know how to cope. Im autistic and dont deal well with change. School was the only socialisation I got. I live alone and everythings just getting so hard. Everything is too much. Im 18, I've been living alone for almost 2 full years while being in full time education and part time work and im done. Im so so tired. Im a kid I shouldn't have to deal with so much.

 My mums a narcissistic abbusive bitch with bpd and my dads an absent addict with schizophrenia, I have no one. My aunt that raised me is terminally ill and stopped talking to me after she got married. 

I have no one. I never imagined myself making is past 14 much less 18 and I have no idea what I'm doing now. The college course im going into isn't even something I want to be doing but its the only thing I could do with my grades. The teachers who made my days a bit better ill never see again. The people I talked to in classes or at lunch ill hardly ever see again. Work is overwhelming. Takijg care of a house is overwhelming. Keeping is overwhelming. Cleaning is overwhelming. Taking care of myself every damn day is overwhelming. Its too fucking much. And im just so so tired.

 If I had the means to I would absolutely end it all but I know if I got scared again like I did last time I'd have no one in the house to find me throwing up the trays of pills I'd taken. I'd have no one to find me if it worked and I honestly don't think anyone would notice me gone for a while. I feel so entirely alone right now, I guess I always have but its so much worse now. 

No one in the world have noticed im bulimic not even my aunt when I flat out told her I've been throwing up since I was fucking 15! No one noticed i can't get out if bed again. No one noticed my fresh sh. No one noticed my binging and starving. Honestly im glad they haven't its my issues.

I told my dad after my frist attempt at 14 I wanted to die and he said its normal, I told my mum a few months ago I was struggling and wanted to die and she said there was nothing she could do to help and I'd just have to live with it. I've reached out for help. I've tried. I even done therapy for a bit. I feel entirely hopeless. And im done.

323,I am constantly on knife-edge,"I'm constantly on knife-edge. At every moment of my life, I am tense and alert as if someone will suddenly attack me, and this is making me very tired. The weird thing is, I wasn't even aware of it until the last few days. There are always scary and dark images in my head that I can't understand what they mean.

I can communicate with people. I've had a lot of friends so far. I've had girlfriends before.

But my relationships are superficial and getting close to someone scares me to death. When someone shows me love or I have real contact with someone, I want to run away.

I was aware that I always felt a lot of discomfort when I went out. But lately I've even realized what I'm afraid of. Because my life passed under a fog. I constantly used music, video games, smoking, masturbation, basically anything that could get out of me right now.

I can't explain in words how hard it is to hold on to life and reality. I always feel like I'm drowning.

For as long as I can remember I've felt like a ""cursed"" or ""sick"" person, like I'll never have a normal life. No one will love me. I won't really have a friend.

It's like I won't have a life, a home. I hated myself and unconsciously used every escape mechanism I could find. I've seen this much more clearly lately.

For the past four years, I have hardly smelled anything. I can't remember the last time I really enjoyed a meal. I don't know how it happened while I was going through all this, but I loved a girl very much and we stayed together for about two years.

I couldn't handle all these troubles and a relationship in my life and we broke up. More precisely, she had to leave me and I couldn't say anything even though I cried for days because she was right. I did him more harm than good.

I have to spend a lot of effort and energy for the simplest and most basic things. I am unable to live. The approach I haven't tried is therapy.

I'll spare the details, but someone important in my life has implied several times now that I am at fault for my depression. Last week was extremely tough for me for several reasons, and therefore I didn't get many house chores done until last minute before my roommates came back. This person told me that I should have done it earlier. I argued that I tried but it was hard, because I had been too unhappy all week to try.

This person essentially said that I wasn't making things better for myself, so of course I was going to be depressed. In their mind's eye, all I did was lie around and cry and play video games. 

I want to get better, but last week was a write-off because I was just so low. And the ironic thing about depression is that it stops you from wanting to do the things that could make you better, because sometimes it doesn't help or you just have no energy.

To get to it, a large factor of my depression is job/ life passion related. I have mentioned this countless times to my therapist and it's well documented. I have been searching for another job, hopefully one that I can feel some sort of passion for, but have had zero luck in this market. (Seriously, I've placed over 300 applications in the past 6 months alone.) And the only thing left for me to think to try, aside from just quitting my job, is to take FMLA and take some time for myself for obvious reasons. The issue is that, though my therapist agrees I need this, my psychiatrist has told me that she would approve a intermittent FMLA but would not approve a long term without me agreeing to spend that time in PHP (partial hospitalization program). PHP is costly, FMLA does not pay you, it's not something that I can do.

I really feel like they're scared that I will have too much time on my hands and be alone but that's exactly what I feel will help me. I took all sorts of tests for them last month and my conditions came out severe depression/anxiety so I really feel like they are worried but haven't spent enough time with me to understand what I am about and how FMLA would help, not harm, me.

This new class of people leaves me feeling hopeless every day. I try to socialize but I usually am interrupted or ignored, or have to fight for attention.  

There's a group of like the 6 coolest kids, and everyone else has to fight for their attention. They are also mean to other people in the college, they are very dry in responses to others, and brag about their money. 

I tried to hang out with the rest of the classmates, but they are also dry and untalkative.

It's very hard going to college because of this. This is a weird shift for me, as I always had a lot of friends in my high school and in my former college and loved my classmates. 

Going to school before was a pleasure for me, I had fun every day. But now, I always get anxiety at the thought of going to school..

I became very nostalgic, and always think about memories with my former classmates. 

I am now struggling with social anxiety, nostalgia and constant sadness because of this shift. It makes me resent my current classmates.

I still try to make jokes or engage in conversations. But because of the anxiety, it's hard. I used to never have anxiety in social situations and don't know what to do to feel like my true self again. I never felt like I had to fight for attention. It makes you feel so crappy.

It seems like these people being constantly depressed for years is just kind of unnatural. Is this what our ancestors lived through or is it us in modern times?

If so, then I believe the answer to fix this is how to we live in this system and not let the system rule and control us? There have been people who wanted to destroy our system and rebuild, but I don't think that can be done. Every rebel failed at their cause. Karl Marx failed miserably. Every cult that crops up fails. So instead of revolutionizing the system because its impossible, I feel like working the system is the right way to go. We must live in modern society, we don't have much of a choice, so we need to not let the system control and own us.

You can be doing very well on paper and it means nothing. Do not invalidate your or other depression because they seem to be able to do things. I was up at 7am everyday but it did not matter because I still hated every moment of being awake.",1654725572.0,1,1.0,2,0,v814o9,t3

342,Seeking help made things worse,"Getting diagnosed with depression was the end of me. I was bored one summer and wanted to do a regular check up and came out with depression and anxiety. Did therapy and found out I lived a shitty life to meet up my parents ridiculous standards while ignoring myself because of fear. Year after year and one experience to another I completely lost sense of self. I’m questioning everything and doubting myself and others, became paranoid and dumber after dating the most narcissistic mentally abusing person. Was told my happy phases were actually hypomanic episodes and got diagnosed with bipolar and was told my slowness is a retardation symptom. Then went to a another doctor and he said no its depression caused by social phobia. Every time I look for help I come out with new fucking problems and get more confused, nothing works, and unfortunately started to read on every symptom and I no longer know what to believe, and can’t trust doctors diagnosis anymore.

345,Wanting Hope,"27f This is my first Reddit post so bear with me. In January I had a vertigo like episode while grocery shopping in Target. I got really shaky and started seeing spots so I went to the Starbucks and drank a green juice because I thought my blood sugar was low for some reason. I never passed out and the juice didn’t really make me feel better. I was getting over a cold that I already ruled out for COVID. I went to urgent care to get checked out and all they did was test me for COVID and send me on my way. That episode gave me some anxiety about grocery shopping so I have since utilized the online shopping frequently. I have been able to go into the stores but I get what I need and get out.

Flash forward to March/April I was experiencing some weird dizziness feeling that I had never had before. At first it was on and off and only make me nervous if I was going to go out or be around people. But once I was around people and it was fine I was fine and enjoyed my time out. The dizziness feeling kept getting worse and worse and more constant to where I was working one day and was shaky and had to sit down. I am a nurse and work in a clinic so all the doctors told me I need to be evaluated by a primary care provider. I got an appointment the next. This provider was new to me as I had not established a primary care doctor where I was living. I told her my symptoms that I was having and was a bit nervous for my appointment because the nurse in me thought something had to be wrong with my body. She did blood work but attributed my symptoms to anxiety and sent me off with Zoloft. I wish I had read reviews before taking it because it was the worst side effects ever. Nausea, sweating, insomnia, racing heart, increased anxiety. I had a panic attack on day 3 to the point where my dad had to drive 3 hours to pick me up and bring me home to his house for the week. I took the Zoloft for 2 more days before being switched to Celexa. I took that for one day and did not sleep an ounce that night so I was fed up and stopped them. I went to my old primary and he gave me Xanax and told me he would have had me go see a therapist before prescribing an SSRI. Which had me lose hope in the health care system a little bit. 

During that time home I realized it was just time for me to move closer to my family and a support system. I also had just gotten out of a toxic back and forth 3 year relationship so I had nothing tying me down there except my job. So I quit my job got out of my lease and am currently at my dads house until my new job starts. I have seen a counselor a couple times who is working with me on past trauma and ways to control my now increased anxiety. I feel like the Zoloft made my anxiety way worse because it showed me how bad it could actually be. I talked to her about maybe trying a new medicine because I was now having anxiety every day and randomly. Mostly about how I was suppose to start a new job with this constant dizziness/swaying happening. So we tried BusPar as it is a more mild medication. We were going back and forth between that and Pristiq but I was terrified of trying another SSRI or SNRI. I took Buspar for 2 days as it increased my anxiety which in turn caused nausea and shaking all day. I stopped and just wanted to do it and get over it on my own but that is not going so well. I am considering trying Pristiq because I just want this feeling to go away. But am looking for some hope and reassurance. Thanks for listening ❤️",1654724119.0,1,1.0,2,0,v80nnf,t3

I've been feeling like this for a while now but it hit me really hard just now. 
I wake up, arround 12, drink a coffee, get on my pc. 
Then I get up put on some clothes pretend to get ready to go outside knowing I won't have the energy, and then pretend to be busy with whatever and just play games for the rest of the day. 

And then at night I will finally get something to eat, sit down and think to myself ""where did all that time go ?, i woke up 12 hours ago and nothing happened"". It's like I'm just spectating at this point. There are many things I know I need to get done, and I'm not lazy. I want to do those things, I really do but I can't get myself to start or finish. 
And so at the end of every single day I sit down and wonder when it got this bad for me.

I'm easily tired. And I need a lot of sleep. Because I go to sleep very late.

351,Feels like I was never good enough,"I look back to my chilhood and it feels like I could never live up to the standarts my parents had for me. I was a quiet and well behaved child, but it was still not enough. On the rare occasions my brother and I would argue (never a physical fight) my parents would threaten to put us in different schools to ""cut that out"" as if it was a daily occurance, and not sometime that happened at most a few times at year. And then my father would start with his stories on how perfect and determined he was from a young age, that he and his four siblings NEVER argued with each other. Funny that when my uncles speak of their childhoods they paint a VERY different picture, but then my father always sees things differently and his interpretation is the only one that matters. 

I was always shy, which today is more of a debilitating social anxiety where I can't even look people in the eye or say a simple ""hi"" without stuttering. There was one day when I was 5, we were at this event with a lot of kids and I went to play on the trampoline. But there were too many kids, I was uncomfortable and stepped down. My father saw this and was enraged that I couldn't stand up for myself and just mingle with the other kids. Another memory that stands out is when I forgot my swimming suit for my swimming classes when I was 10 or something. To 99% of the planet it would be a funny moment, but I was made to feel like the most stupid person on the planet, I sat next to my father waiting for my brother to finish the class in complete silence. I very rarely forgot any assingment or homework, I actually prayed not to every night before bed, yet one time I forgot to ask something for my father he told me: ""Tomorrow you go to school and tell your teacher 'I am an imbecile who forgot so and so'"". If I said this now he would tell me I'm lying, that it never happened. 

I remember driving home from my best friend's house at the end of the first semester of 2nd grade. All my father could talk about from the car until we arrived back home was how well my friend was doing, how his grades were perfect and how we should be like that. From the following year until 8th grade I had the highest grades in all of my small school, but then the subject changed. Then  being the best student meant nothing, because a lot of kids who were the best in school turned out to achieve nothing later. Even still, I had a lot of difficulty with math, unlike my best friend who I was compared. One day my father tried to teach me, which ended with him screaming at me. To this day math terrifies me, and I can't do the most basic equations. Then the issue was my friend. For some reason my parents always distrusted him. They would say I was a follower and obeyed him in everything, but what did they expected when at home I could never have my own voice or opinion? Then in high school when this friend stopped talking to me, my parents blamed me because ""you must've done something"". And my mother asked me to be his friend again because she missed hanging out with his parents, when she was the most vocal against him while we were friends.

I see how other people grew up, being allowed to be silly and act out, to voice their opinion and develop their own unique personalities. Whenever my father asked me something and I answered with cerainty he would either assume I was lying or insist ""are you sure?"". Then my default answer became ""I don't know"", but then he had an issue with that. The other day he asked me something, I replied with certainty, he was very annoyed and said ""You know everything, don't you?"". This coming from the same person who tells me I need to be determined, that I need to be decisive and to know things. 

My father complains we hardly spend time together as a family, yet everytime we do he acts as if it's such a sacrifice to be there. I cook and bake on holidays, and he always find issues with it and just makes it such a stressful situation. Then if I want to take photos of the dish he gets angry because he wants to eat. We had my uncles, his brothers, visiting recently and the more I tried to participate the more annoyed he became, even my uncles looked uncomfortable at his fowl mood and how quickly he would lash out for the smallest things. He can only speak to me while being extremelly rude, then he doesn't know why I barely even try. Whenever I have an idea he shoots me down, if I say black he says white. I remember once when I was a teen, starting to let my hair grow, we were at a mall and he whispered to me ""everyone is looking at you"". Now he says I need to face my fears and be out in the world.

I gave up on life five years ago after graduating college. I'm a closeted trans woman, when it became clear my parents would not help me despite having done everything they wanted for all those years I just gave up. Haven't worked or continued my education ever since. I feel like a lab experiment trapped in one of those tubes filled with liquid, watching everyone move on with their lives while I'm stuck. And now its too late, I will never be normal. But it hurts being 26 and entirely dependent on my parents, unable to do anything on my own. Now my father is trying to push me into programming, something I never had an interest, but he will insist on it because that's what he wants. It was never about me being happy. 

After wishing for death and thinking daily about suicide since I was 14, I finally started to speak out loud about it. My mother always thinks out loud and unloads her worries and morbid thoughts to me, so might as well do it too. When it feels like I cant hold it, I just say ""at least I'm killing myself before the end of the year."" And I really feel like it will happen. Since last year I feel different, as if I just know I am close to death.

I can't stop this pain and I don't have friends, family, gf or anyone to talk to and I'm not in a state to even reply anyone. What I wanted in my early 30s is owning my own home and get married and have my own family. Just 2 wishes but even that is not written in my life. The life just feels pointless to me. I don't want to go out, meet anyone, see anyone, eat anything.

I've had depression since I was 14 [I'm 24 now] and the reason for it is unknown. The ones that I always shared about all these made me feel even more terrible for myself and they just used to tell me to always think about my parents first before doing anything to myself. If no one thinks about me why should I think about them and suffer. I don't want to live because life holds nothing for me and I can't ignore anything now.

I never was happy with my life, no relationship, no love, no friends, no family support but I'm okay with all these. It's just unbearable pain and suffering that I can't bear it this time and the easiest method is kill myself. I was never this violent before to kill myself but this time it's just crossed everything. I don't love anyone, no one loves me, and I don't love my life enough to even remain here for a day. I just only wish I had at least better parents. I'm just totally complete alone in this world with no one with me except this phone and reddit installed in it. I've always been everyone's last priority, ignored, belittled and treated like a street garbage but I'm done getting treated like that. I hope no one ever feels as bad as what I feel every day and they always get love and affection and care.

I wish I could write more but just wanna write something to at least have some prayers for me because I never had anyone to at least ever think about me. I'm writing to let other people know what was going in my mind and how badly I'd to suffer all these everyday with no scope of getting better just for one day. 

Did I hate anyone? No I still do love them but I'm just not fit for this world and I'm for once doing something for myself to ease the pain. Hope people around me at least respect me after my last breath.",1654720678.0,1,1.0,2,0,v7zefu,t3
357,I'll never be able to achieve my dreams,"Life is getting harder these days because of the pressure coming from my assignments and I'm feeling stuck and pretty down. I'm on the last years of college and having a lot of things to do, but I don't have any motivation or energy to do them because that's now what I wanted to be doing with my life at this point.

I never wanted to go to college, but felt compelled by my social circle even though I felt this life was not for me. I don't feel like I'm meant to work normal jobs, stay locked in an office or a lab for 8 to 12 hours a day. Just thinking about that makes me miserable.

I used to love music and wanted to be an artist/musician (even got some money to put out a song on Spotify once), but due to depression I lost interest and my passion for a lot of things, music included, but only one passion remained after all these years: gaming.

My only dream/goal/lust in life (and I can't stress this enough. It's the only thing that makes my heart beat faster in terms of what to do with my life) is to be an e-Sports professional (playing Counter-Strike professionally to be exact), but what kills me is that I KNOW I won't achieve that, and it frustrates me because all I hear from people (my therapist included) is that we should pursue our dreams and work hard to do the things we really want at the expense of living a miserable life, and I call that utter bullshit! Life made me realize that this story of pursuing your dreams is for people who already have their life secured (of fools that fall for that small talk). I barely have money to my basic needs so I can't even think about spending time training instead of working or even buying better gear to play at top level, so what I am supposed to do? All the top players out there who are winning thousand of dollars in trophies are my age, or even younger and had better chances and conditions in their lives. I just feel delayed, like my time is passing by and I won't be able to play on tier 1 level even if I had a unrealistic chance.

I'm totally disappointed with society and with myself. Unfortunately all I see for my future is a life of bitterness for not being able to even TRY to pursue my dreams due to how the world forces us to live in jobs that makes us unhappy in order to barely have enough money to SURVIVE.

My room is a complete mess to where I can barely walk around and I only leave my house to work or get drunk. I always knew I had problems but it has obviously gotten really bad now and I feel so stressed out and hopeless.

Haven't had a girlfriend since my first at 16, constantly lose money in gambling or the stock market because I just keep playing whenever I win until its all gone, have zero energy all day with a terrible sleep schedule, feel like even when I get on medication I wont be able to succeed at my next school without adderall, have beyond wrecked my reputation at home with past friends, girls, and family, feel like I'm letting my family down and don't show any gratitude to my parents or spend time with them, etc.

Just feel like I am dying to be completely honest. I just want to finish school and get a good paying job and have my own place and a girlfriend or a dog. Once I turned 17 it felt like the real me died forever.

Thank you for anyone who reads this and can give me any hope or advice. I am sorry if I triggered anyone with anything in this post I am new to this community.",1654717294.0,1,1.0,3,0,v7y3mo,t3

375,My best is never good enough,"I have worked at the same credit union for 4 years and it's always the same shit.

""You're so experienced, you should be performing better""

""You're an example to the newer employees""

""The expectation is the same for everyone""

It's all stats and cross-sell numbers. It's never enough that I'm there and helping members with a smile on my face.

Worst part about all this is my leads know about my mental state. They know what meds I take and that I'm going to therapy. I have told them *verbatim* that with my depressive episodes, sometimes just being here on time with my customer service voice on is incredibly difficult and going above that feels impossible. They know all this, and they keep saying ""let me know how I can help"" even though I know for a fact there's nothing they can do.

It's never enough that I'm here, that members like me, and that I'm knowledgeable about my position and credit union policies, even though most of the time that is me doing my best. I have to be selling products, never having outages, never missing anything, despite me already doing everything they recommend to avoid those things.

And the best part is when every few months I get put on or threatened with corrective action. Since I've been at this branch, I've never been off corrective long enough to get a raise when the entire credit union's base pay went up, so now I make less than the brand new tellers starting next week.

And the meetings where my manager pretty much rails against me for my performance and I reiterate the same struggles I've had since day 1 here are great, basically saying they expect better of me and I need to put more effort in, apparently not realizing that's more likely to put me in another episode than it is to fix anything. I know you expect better out of me, I really do, but I need you to understand I'm giving it everything I've got just to do the bare minimum and telling me that it's simply not enough absolutely kills me. But of course I can't tell them that.

I just want to come to work and do my fucking job and go home. I'm not worried about getting my cross sell numbers up, I'm worried about finding anything to look forward to. I'm worried about finding any little thing to keep me going. I'm struggling to care about anything and you want me to care about some arbitrary numbers that have barely any correlation to how happy members are with their service? Fuck off.

376,I'm not sure how I should feel,"So... I have depression, to be more specific I have ""dystimia"" Already had four sessions of therapy but to be honest I don't know how should I feel about this. 

I've been reading things online (trying to read ""official"" Sources and not just Wikipedia) but I'm feeling lost

For example: when did it start? How much of my personality is because of this? would I be any different? 

Because for example all my life my whole family has called me... Grumpy? Angry? But what if that was just a symptom. What about the people telling me that I'm to serious or boring because I Don't like going to partys or doing to much stuff and again what if that was just a symptom. 
obviously this breaks even more my self esteem (that is really really low) and my anxiety

377,Perhaps my dad helped cause my mental illness(es)?,"I’ll never forget my dad commenting on me having too many female friends. Male friends always teased me for being flamboyant so I could never pick up with that. It’s crazy to see I have no friends right now.  

I’ll never forget my dad mocking my excessive interest in skincare and haircare as a guy to the point that I stopped using anything and allowed my acne to flair up. 

I’ll never forget my dad for picking on me for wearing skinny jeans. Occasionally making my body a topic in public and giggling about it while I suffered in silence. I eventually moved on to looser jeans. 

I’ll never forget him for pointing out that I wear too much dark clothes, and should dress more like my cousins. Had self-image issues and darker clothing brought less attention to my body. 

I’ll never forget my father for being physically and emotionally abusive towards my mom. Cheating on her. Breaking our built in cupboards when he once last his temper. Abandoning us and starting a new family elsewhere. Destroying our home both literally and physically. To the point where we got evicted and now literally had no home. 

I recently dropped out of uni and had to come live with him for a bit while I get myself on my feet again. But now that I’ve had time to think, it’s hit me hard how much trauma this dude has caused me. How I’ve tried so hard to mould myself to whatever he wanted to the point that I had no longer knew who I was. And since he’s been doing this my entire life, I just thought that was merely a flaw in my character but rather years of intentional conditioning by a parent. 

In the last few years he’s changed a bit but I’m unsure if it’s conveniently because his age is catching up to him or because he’s genuinely turned a new leaf. Idk. But what I do need is therapy to get to fix some things because my dad’s ways are the root of so many issues I’ve had growing up. 

You know, after I finished high school and just before I got accepted into the prestigious uni I just dropped out of, my dad told me he thought that I went against odds. And now that I think of it, i can’t tell if it was him being proud or him feeling crap knowing he caused many of those “odds” he was speaking of.",1654715880.0,1,1.0,2,0,v7xk2y,t3

If your anxiety/depression is linked to a specific relationship (romantic or otherwise), I would advise you fix the relationship or to end it and move on


The sooner you can release your hand from the grip of the dog's bite, the sooner you may be able to recover.

Fully appreciate this dynamic is not necessarily at the heart of most depressive episodes, but for those facing a similar dynamic, I hope the above is helpful.

Part of my depression is insecurity and isolation. I'm often excluded or overlooked for things which makes me feel like people don't actually appreciate the traits *they claim* are good in me or want to be around me. It happens in school, at work, with friendships, in dating...I'm always told to ""just be myself"" or to ""put yourself out there"". I'm told to keep trying, to be social (I'm in several clubs and work part time), to be kind (I'm told I'm nice, caring, polite), to apply for this or that job (I'm always great candidate for something but never receive the role). 

Guys will express interest in me then tell me that they don't want anything serious or that they just got out of a relationship and then a month later be going out with someone. Friends will claim they love my personality and then never invite me to hangouts or reach out to me (I *always* text first). When is enough enough??

394,"It’s not strong, but I’ve been having the urge to self-harm for a few days now.","I guess I’ll tell you what triggered me, it’s a little stupid but it hurts:

So my sister went to our fathers grave and sat down for some reason and something bit her on her ass. Well she woke up today complaining to my mom aboud how much pain she was in, waking her up and everything. My mom jumps out of bed, puts on some clothes and immediately takes her to urgent care when she asked and did not say anything before she left. She came back home just now and told me this when I asked her where she was all morning. 


This upset me, because a couple of weeks ago I had a pretty intense ear infection that hurt really bad. I asked her two days before her next off day if she could take me, she said okay. Well, the day comes and she’s just lying in bed for a good portion of the afternoon. I gently remind her, she tells me she just wants to take a short nap. Urgent care where I live doesn’t close until seven-eight, it was only three something so I wasn’t tripping even being in a lot of pain. 

Hours pass, it’s getting close to seven, I go in there again to remind her and she starts yelling and getting annoyed with me. She tells me that said urgent care doesn’t close until nine when I’m looking at google AND their website that clearly says seven. I’m literally begging and pleading with her to take me and she’s still yelling, and eventually tells me “it’s always something with you.” 

So I go in my room and watch as time eventually catches up to seven, and I cry to myself with my best friend on the phone. Well after seven my mom comes in my room and is like “oh you were right, it was seven I’ll take you tomorrow.” I was so over her by that point I just told her to get out. I was very suicidal that day and my friend was worried so she insisted I go to her house, which I did for a few days. 

The terrible thing is, what I just explained is tame compared to everyday life. I’m constantly treated like shit by both my mom and older sister. I’m always excluded from things and it always feels like I’m on the outside looking in. I’m always by myself and I wouldn’t dare talk to either one about my feelings, because I’m constantly blamed, judged, shunned, and get angry at for expressing my feelings of feelings depressed and sometimes suicidal. I’m told to get over it or that I’m only saying things for attention. There will be times where sometimes I just need my mom to be there for me, and she can’t even do that, telling me “what do you expect me to do about it?” 

It feels like my life is constantly drifting into a shit show and it’s getting harder ti find ways to cope. Everyday i feel constantly empty and as if I’m just a burden that’s not going anyway, despite just starting college (again). Journaling helps a little, but not every time. I feel bad to keep relying on my best friend, I’ve relied on people too much in the past and it completely overwhelmed them to the point where they stopped being friends with me.

396,Is it internet addiction or adhd?,"I've been addicted to the internet since I was 14. My life has been steadily going to absolute shit ever since. I ruined my academic life, I ruined my career, I have no friends. My parents hate me and I really don't do anything all day except lie in bed and scroll for hours on my phone. I'm basically a big loser in every way.

I can't really afford to get tested right now, but are there any chances I may have adhd instead? A big part of my stangnancy is being unable to plan a way to pull myself out of this, there are things I want to to, I just don't know how. I do things for sometime and then give up and it never becomes a habit. I never get fully invested even in things I tell myself I'm interested in(eccept for music maybe). My attention span is horrible and I don't know how much of it is due to the internet addiction but I cannot even watch a 10minute yt video now and if I do, I do it mindlessly. I feel like I can't think or problem solve anymore. When I could stil read a few years back, i always thought it was odd how I wasn't really thinking about the plot or the characters and just trying to finish the book. I thought I liked reading but idk anymore. I procrastinate on and avoid difficult things all the time. I can't even apply to jobs because the very act of looking for something suitable and going through the steps of making a resume and maybe submitting it is confusing and overwhelming to me. Infact I didn't even apply to many colleges because I felt like I didn't know how to. In school I saved things for later all the time, because I never understood lectures and always felt dumb when others got it. But I could pay attention sometimes idk. Can an internet addiction cause all this? Everyone uses the internet but their lives aren't falling apart...I feel like such an imposter. Maybe I'm just the laziest person in the entire history of lazy people and did this to myself yk. idk

I hardly have any memories of my life and this is a big reason why I'm not very sure about the adhd because I don't think I had adhd as a kid. But then again I identify with the inattentive type the most and I always had a lot of anxiety which probably masked several symptoms.

398,Many problems.,"Not sure where to start but i am writing this in hope for some peace and maybe to find answers within. Anyway for the most part ive had my ups and downs just like anyone else and have dealt with mental struggles (chronic low self-esteem, having to prove myself to others, and other minor problems)  most my life and for the most part i find a way, atleast i used to. About a year ago i was going through some changes as a person and mostly maturing for the better. Soon after i felt myself dwelling in the past aswell and wanting an extremely excessive need for control, this need for control had completely as ironically has controlled me and my life and has lead me down some dark places and thoughts. I know i must learn to let go but its felt impossible, this need to control every little thing. It has taken a heavy toll on not only my mental but as well as my physical which has only made everything worse.

My mental state had made is very hard to focus on a lot of things that will put me in the right direction like my physical health. It seems as its all catching up to me and not to mention the amount of anxiety i have felt out of this including depression obviously. Now i think atleast to me not having my life together only makes everything worse but i am more here to try and find peace with this need for control. But today i have decided to post here because over the course of 2021 i had felt true hopelessness and at the time i somehow dealt with it, not so much today everything seems to be getting worse and i felt that hopelessness once again.

A year of this amount of pain and suffering has started to become unbearable and i feel so lost now. I just want to be free so i can move on with my life.",1654711618.0,1,1.0,3,0,v7vxf6,t3
399,I fucking hate technology and it fucking hates me.," 

I'm not sure if this is the community to help, but hear me out. For years and years, probably since the beginning of me owning a computer, I have had nothing but silly problems that to any other person would probably never happen, or is easily figured out. I am only 30 years old and I feel like I know how to use a computer... But even my tech savvy husband at times doesn't understand why computer or the internet acts the way it does.

**My current (reoccurring) problem**: I have a business on Shopify, been open for a couple of months, that will not show up on Google no matter how many times I follow the directions and instructions to get my business on Google. I have followed the directions correctly and I have made a Google business profile, I have registered my business with Google, I have Shopify supposedly posting my items on Google. The thing is, I have received absolutely nothing from either Google or Shopify telling me anything about my business being visible to the public and when I search directly for my site on google it says cannot find webpage. I am at such a loss because the exact same situation happened with Etsy and Squarespace.

I guess my question is, is technology this difficult for everyone else? Or is there something going on that I just can't understand no matter how hard I try?

Even the first time posting on Reddit this didn't work, which is another thing common among social media platforms I use... Nearly every post I make anywhere does not get approved with very little explanation... Everything is censored to the point of no use...

400,I want to help,"My best friend is severly depressed. While on lockdown he completely went no contact. I managed to regain contact and he told me that he had to move with his mom (which he hates) because things at his dads place got out of control. Weeks later he took his moms car and drove out to a nearby city because he hated living with her.
At this time I told him that he was always welcomed at my home and since then he has been living at my parents house.

The thing is, he is really depressed now. I really want to help but nothing seems to move him. He has a girlfriend but is going out of state for college and im afraid how things are going to turn out when she is not here. He is going to a psichiatrist and psycologist but thinks nothing will help. He finally finished high school while staying with us but has no other plan.

And apartment hunting is hard as it is on top of being part time cause no full time position are available. That’s not why I’m here though.

414,I feel like I am in a rabbit hole.,"Bad things happen daily and we cannot avoid that. Sometimes things get off track and it's just a part of life. I feel like I am continously being pushed down a rabbit hole, and whenever I try to climb out of the hole (and successfully do), I get pushed down again. Recently I feel like there is no point trying to climb out of the hole anymore. 

I used to be on meds for a short amount of time and i felt great, but then after 2 months the meds stopped working and everything got even worse (while I was still taking the meds), so I stopped (taking the meds) all at once. Things have been a little bit out of hand lately. Everyday I return home feeling relieved because I did not kill myself throughout the day, and I was able to force myself to live another day. Maybe before I know it, days would turn into months and months would turn into years and this feeling would go away by itself.

I went to therapy once. She said that my ways of thinking was ""flawed"" and that I needed to be ""fixed"". I never went back since. I feel deeply troubled that she refered to me as someone who is ""broken"". I am not ""broken"", I do think too much and read too much into things, maybe that's why I slowly became depressed in the last 10 years or so but I am NOT BROKEN OR FLAWED. Fuck her. 

That being said, I am not taking any treatments (for now). My mom has been harrassing me into seeing a doctor (I did make an appointment on the upcoming 17th) but I am still very reluctant of going. I don't want to be dependent on the meds because I feel like after a while of taking something you would have to either increase the dose or change to something else. I refuse to live the rest of my life chugging medications down my throat.

427,When does it get better?,"For some context I’ve been dealing with this for about 6 years now. I moved from my childhood town when I was 16 to a whole new state 13 hours away from my old home. Safe to say I didn’t know a single person and already being a socially awkward person it made it even harder to make friends. 

What I didn’t know was I already had anxiety and this move helped develop severe social anxiety to the point where I dropped out of school before I even had my first day because I was too scared of what they would think of me. 

Being that I never had contact with anyone my age for 6 months after moving here I got used to being alone. I was introduced to my moms friends son who I forced myself to hang out with so I could get back into the real world. 

That got me into a whole group of friends who long story short introduced me to the guy who became my best friend for the better part of 2 years. We did everything together and if one of us were there so was the other. Inseparable. 

I ended up getting a job which cut the hours we spent together and he started hanging out with other people which was fine but when I stopped getting invited places or found out everyone was at his house and no one wanted to tell me I started distancing myself. He also then moved a town away, got a full time job and I see him maybe once a month

Eventually I started dating a girl who seemed to be the love of my life after finally getting over a girl from my home town who was with me for 3 years before I moved. This new girl was everything I asked for. Someone to be with frequently and talk to about my problems, stayed over night and helped take care of a dog we got together. Eventually she cheated on me and moved to Ohio. 

That job I had gotten eventually forced me out after being loyal for 3 years. Tried moving me to another location over double the distance away for the same pay. So I got a new job and have been loving it

Now with inflation I need a new job but can’t quit this one because without me my boss wouldn’t have any full time employees. I also never graduated high school so a real job is hard to come by 

Now I sit in my room every night wondering when it gets better. When do the days of waking up, going to work, going home and sleeping going to change. When am I going to meet a girl who isn’t gonna cheat on me or play games. When am I gonna meet a group of friends who invite me places. When am I gonna get my old life back.

I’m also a carer for my disabled mother who I’m currently trying to get moved out of her hoarded shithole and crappy village to somewhere she can have some independence and social interaction outside of the small minded idiots that we currently call neighbours. It’s been almost a year since I got my stepdad removed from the home for being abusive towards her (the neighbours seem to think I did it out of spite) and whilst I hate being stuck abroad, I’m dreading going home. 

I know when a bad depression spell is starting to hit because I start sleeping during the day. I’ve been napping most days since being here and it doesn’t help that I’ve been halving my 100g setraline the past 3 days as I was going to run out. I’m returning to the UK tomorrow but all I want to do is ignore my phone (best friends and work included) and crawl into bed. I’ve been especially weepy the past few days and feel like I can’t face anything. I lay awake last night imagining myself drowning in the pool. I’m so sick of feeling like a failure and unable to do basic things like communicating (I’m usually very good at it, especially when it comes to emotions). 

I can feel myself shutting down and I’m scared. Any help or advice would be much appreciated.",1654701878.0,0,0.75,2,0,v7s6sc,t3

I went to school for four years to be a engineer and I graduated 1 year ago. I've been applying to jobs ever since and I have not gotten one job. I've had a internship and still have not landed a job. 

Right now I'm working as a secretary paying almost nothing and I struggle to eat and pay my rent each month. What was the point of going to school. At this point I am begging companies to let me work.

The rent prices and even grocery prices make it impossible to survive without a salary job. Today I just cried in my bed because I don't know how I'm going to keep going at this rate. What's the point of applying to jobs. At this point it seems that I'll never get above water. 

Collage was a scam, all the jobs reject me because I don't have enough experience. How do I get experience then????? Now I'm in debt for a degree they told me would grantee I always had work. 

I never asked to be born and now I'm forced to live up to capitalisms standards that were made up entirely by some rich white man. Money isn't even real, restaurants throw away food at the end of the day and refuse to give it to houseless people. ITS GOING IN THE TRASH ANYWAYS WHATS THE HARM?

I'm just spiraling when I think about it more, none of this is real, it was completely made up and we all just march along like little soldiers to do what we are told because we have no say or we die.

446,"Suffering got me out, Practicality keeps me out","I came to the realization that I suffer no matter what I do. That I hate myself when I do nothing and that I hate myself when I try to do anything. I knew, as everyone does, that the only way out for me was to do something

Not all the time, or most of the time. Not anything I deemed notable. Maybe brush my teeth. Maybe get a minute of sunlight. When I thought about something to do, and I reminded myself that everything is shit all the time anyways, I had a higher chance of doing something. 

I'm very practical now. I brush (when I think about it (sometimes)) because it saves me thousands of dollars. I go outside because my body needs it.

In a way, I treat my life as a serf treated their garden. I have to weed the crops or else I starve, I have to water or else I starve, I have to pick off bugs or else I starve. I might starve anyways, but I can not afford to waste a good growing season.

Every bug I plucked from a leaf gets me some chance of a  future return. That's what I have to tell myself. I have to believe it. I'd rather be fed on belief than starve on fact.

447,Yesterday i got diagnosed with mild depression .,"I would type an entire story on how it all started but I’ll just keep it short. Sorry i made any mistakes prior to you reading this. Hope this story is easy to follow.


Growing up i had a supportive loving family, friends and childhood. Had nothing to complain about i thought. I went to great schools got good grades and was loved by most. As i got older i started feeling down about myself and low of energy all the time. I stopped doing things i was interested in, cried everynight and was at my lowest breaking point this lasted for four years. I didn’t understand why i felt like this constantly on repeat. I felt like my mood was just going in circles. so i did some research. I searched on Google my symptoms and i know that’s not the best place because of inaccuracies but i did it anyway. I came across the biopolar disorder and felt like the symptoms best match with what i was going through. I thought oh.. this is what i have because they symptoms say you’re happy one minute the next you’re not. That was wrong, i was wrong. I set up a doctors appointment &amp; was nervous as fuck to be honest lol. I was nervous about sharing my story and mind you first time seeing a professional therapist/diagnoses. 


They did some test questions first which came back positive from that point on that was just the beginning hearing that made me just as nervous. i was ready by then so i went in sat down about an hour discussion i truthfully answered each question the best i could. I learned so much about mental health disorders and what bipolar really is. Minutes after my full session i got told that i have mild depression, i felt pretty devastated but I felt a huge relief. From what I’ve learned i have depressive episodes that come every period or so. They can last for a long time then go away for a long time. Learning that made lots of since. I decided that all those years of worrying, going in spirals were enough. I signed up to therapy that I’m looking foward to going to soon. 

I really hope this helps people feel like they aren’t alone. This is just the beginning. I have hope i don’t plan on giving up no time soon. I won’t let depression win. For more of a good life to come.",1654691137.0,3,1.0,25,0,v7of16,t3

453,TIL that sometimes indulging in self pity is okay..,"Let me start by saying in no way should you let this become a habit..

Lately with the help of a psycho therapist, I’m starting to learn about the reason for my depression/discovering why I have been depressed as of the last year. 

I’ve always been the shoulder to cry on for many people I know. Even if I know I’m essentially being used; I still allow people to use me because it had made me feel better/good. 

The reason why I’ve indulged in this form of self care is for the short lived feeling of accomplishment of helping someone get through rough times. I do this knowing it’s sucking the life out of me/affecting my life and it’s a really bad habit.

The reason why I do it (besides wanting to help people) is because I feel guilty about leaving much of my family including my sister behind to move with my mother half way across the country to escape my mentally abusive father. Almost every night he would go down to my room and scream and degrade me to the point I would be sprawled on my bed in uncontrollable tears. Even though I know I made the right decision there is always the fear of leaving my young sister in the same situation I was in. Not to mention I cut contact with everyone I knew from back home.

I never realized I still felt guilty about it because I tried my best to never think about it and compartmentalize. Without know it I was in so much pain from the guilt that I’ve done something wrong and it’s been eating me alive for years without me even knowing it. (On a side note I dealt with the ptsd from the environment I was in) after learning about these new feelings I’ve also opened the door to learning more about my feelings and after researching on it and trying to figure it out I’ve come to the concluding that I hate myself.. I didn’t even know it but I am always self sabotaging, isolating, and never feeling like I have worth. 
Something that really hit home while researching is that even if I am showered with compliments it would only take 1 insult for me to get “triggered” or let it mess with me. And the reason for that is if you don’t think you deserve good things, love, or self worth then you will brush off the compliments and believing you’re not worthy of accepting praise. When 1 insult comes my way it hits hard because I believe it. I don’t believe any of the compliments I get no matter how many but I do believe the insult. That is a huge problem with me because my friends joke around and say stuff like “oh dude you’re so shit at bowling” or something and even though that’s how we all joke; when I hear it I take it to heart and get offended.

So today I learned that self pity is okay sometimes and as long as it doesn’t become a habit. I’m often told be others that “I have nothing to be sad about, or you shouldn’t be sad because you have things going for you” and because of that I haven’t indulged in self pity at all because I am programmed to think it’s a sign of weakness and I have no reason to do it. I watched a YouTube video of a therapist saying that it’s okay to indulge in self pity sometimes because it’s a way to help comfort yourself and just like crying it can help reduce stress and all of that. I did indulge in it today and I feel better. It feels good to pity yourself sometimes.

457,Needing advice for helping a depressed friend who is depressed because they aren't dating anyone,"My friend (23/M) lives across the country from me so I can only offer my support and time online. He's been feeling particularly down about his life for the past several months and I'm not sure what to do.   


Here's his problem: He was in a draining and rather abusive relationship sometime in 2020 for a year. He said he gave everything to this person and she was constantly demanding him for more, which has left him with trauma and feelings of inadequacy. But now he's looking for a new romantic partner, despite knowing he has unresolved trauma that's still affecting him. Also he doesn't want to go to therapy, doesn't want to talk about his feelings/needs, doesn't want to change anything about himself and has a superiority complex because he feels like he understands things about the world no one else can understand. He just wants to basically find someone who has all the same hobbies/interests as him and can understand him, see past all his flaws, because he's a bit of a romantic and wants to be rescued.  


And I have no idea what to do with him when he comes to me once every one or two weeks telling me how lonely he is and how no girl will ever love him because they're all shallow and refuse to see that he is truly a good person underneath his exterior. Recently, he asked me if I could go out of my way to call him and ask him to spend time with me so he can essentially feel wanted and I said sure of course. But I still have no idea what he wants and I can clearly tell he doesn't enjoy being around me. He won't be direct either with what he wants from me. Should I just keep calling him and trying to hang out with him so he feels wanted?   


To make matters worse, I'm also depressed and I have anxiety and I'm just a generally shy and introverted person so every time we're together, it's just us sitting in silence and he doesn't want to talk about anything or play a game or watch a video. I really want to help him and if I could I wish the perfect girl would just show up at either his doorstep or discord or something. I'm just lost. I want him to be happy and I feel like I should know what to do as a depressed person myself but I'm actually willing to work on my flaws to improve myself, whereas, he wants to be accepted in spite of all his unhealthy and somewhat toxic behaviors and traits.",1654661145.0,2,1.0,2,0,v7gfql,t3

461,41 male texas. ending my life tonight. can't do this anymore.,"I am 41, suffered through molestation from ages 5-8, forced into incest when I was 7 through 10 with my cousins by their dad and my step dad. I was beaten daily by my step dad and mom from ages 5 to 15. I suffered 10 years homeless and have witnessed so many things in my life. 

Never went to school, when I was 18, I was kicked out and forced to be homeless. Didn't know how to read or write or anything.  I grew up on a small farm and forced into manual labor on the land and was never allowed to go anywhere or do anything other than work the land. 

Grew up only around my family and never been around others until I became 18 and was kicked out and forced into homelessness with no real world educations or knowing other than what I did on the land.
When I was homeless, I had guys trying to rape me, kill me, beat me. stealing what little belongings I had. I witnessed this woman being raped and murdered in an alley in Houston, TX. Everything I do is a bust. It is why I am ending my life on my birthday next year in January. I am tired of being a failure and nothing ever working out or going good for me. I just can't handle it anymore. I have spent ten years trying to get a car to live in and when I finally bought one last year I got scammed out of 2.5k usd dollars.
 
I am tired of fighting to try to stay above water and all I am doing is slowly drowning. I have spent the past ten years trying to get out of Texas, get a GED, or find an apartment based on income or HUD housing, even tried for ten years now to find a room to rent I could afford while on disability. I have spent the past ten years trying to get on my feet and all I get is knocked down. 

I now rent a bedroom from an elderly woman who makes it miserable for me to live here. I have no where else to go. I have tried rooms for rent and they want too much or they won't allow me to rent to them. I was supposed to get my first apartment in February this year but I needed eye surgery at the end of February so I lost that apartment. 

I have spent the past eight years in the dating scene on every dating site free and paid and every dating sub up and down on reddit but all I get is rejected, told I am ugly, disgusting, worthless, useless, I have nothing to offer woman. I am trash, I don't deserve to be loved or in a relationship. Ghosted, told to end my life, laughed at, mocked at, made fun of. 

I been morbidly obese since I was 6 years old no matter how healthy I ate or how active I was. growing up I never was allowed anything but veggies and salads and chicken thanks to my grandma trying to keep me skinny but it never helped the weight piled on for no reason. In 1996 I was up to 700 lbs. I am now at and around 450lbs. I am 41 and have struggled with it my entire life. I was rejected by a woman 6 days ago who was around 350lbs and told me I need to lose weight and get around 200 lbs before I even consider dating or someone being with me but yet she was well over 300lbs herself and replied to my dating post. 
 
I am on disability and have tried for ten years to find a job either online or in person like a desk job or computer gig job but everything I find requires skills I don't have or can't do even if I tried learning them. I can't do manual labor anymore because I have arthritis in my lower back, knees and feet. just last week I went to go wash clothes and my arthritis was acting up in my feet and it felt like every step I took was stepping on shards of glass and nails. I also have learning issues where it takes me longer to learn things than other people and even then sometimes I still can't learn them no matter how much or how long I try. And trust me, I do try. it isn't just a few months then give up, no it is a year or two then still not getting anywhere that is when I decide to give up.

I just can't keep living life like this and spend another ten years or more like this. Constantly fighting to stay afloat and not getting anywhere and no matter how hard I try I just end up right back in the same spot as if I never did anything or made a phone call or filled anything out. It will be as if I never even tried and all the work and energy and time and effort and ideas I have put to use  never happened. I have spent ten years being homeless and on the streets no one ever helping me or giving me a chance. busting my ass trying to get a job but all I could get was day labor jobs or season jobs that were cash under the table. 

I just can't do another ten years or more. I can't spend another waking minute living this failure of a life and this lonely life having absoltuely not one friend or family member and constantly spending every waking moment by myself, no one to watch stuff with or share things with or who has my back or just someone there to listen to me. I haven't been hugged since 1997. last time anyone told me they loved me and meant it, it was my cat and back in 1995 when he meowed at me and licked my cheek before I had to have him to down because of cancer in his jaw.

I live in a dead end town with absolutely nothing but a Walmart, 30 fast food places. No uber, no lyft, no taxi, no bus. nearest town is one hour away one way and it is mostly nothing but dr's offices, hospitals, clinics, banks, fast food places. Nearest flea market is 3 hours away one way. I can't escape this town and I can't better my life. 

I just can't keep living life like this and spend another 10 or so years like this constantly fighting and trying to find things to help better my life then it just blows up in my face. Its like asking someone to live ten years with cancer and no pain meds no chemo. Its like slowly being cut into by a dull scalpel from a dr and being fully awake and no pain meds or anything to put you out. I am going to end it. I can't keep doing this or living life like this. I just can't do it. I am done.",1654655403.0,2,1.0,3,0,v7en3d,t3

463,How to go to work when you just can't?,"I don't really know what to say here other than I don't want to work. I don't enjoy the work I'm doing. I don't enjoy the people I work with. But jve felt this way with the last two jobs I had. I don't feel like there is any point. I look at the next 40 years of this, of grinding away and exhausting myself to try and make ends meet. Maybe buy a house and go in debt for the rest of my life. Maybe be able to afford to have kids if they're planned not accidental. I don't know. 

I know with all that I am that I have to go to work. I'm aware of that fact and I'm in the shit financially already. I just get this deep burning dread, unhappiness, discomfort or something inside me that just does not want to. I've never been this person. I've worked 12-14hr days in kitchen's. I've worked 14 straight days before. I've helped plumbers dig in and out new grease traps. I destroyed my hip and needed surgery on it but I still went to work and walked around on it for 2 weeks. I've worked hard before. I know how to, I'm not scared of hard work or anything. I just feel done. 

This is killing me. I feel like a lazy pos. I'm in a relationship and not holding up my end of the deal. I'm aware that the world is moving past me while I'm going backwards. I want to change. But I don't want to just force myself in. I go to work angry and depressed and have to spend the day fighting off co workers about ""why the sad face"". It makes me unreliable to my bosses which makes it hard to get good references to another workplace. Idk what the answer is. Everyone I talk to says ""just go to eork"" like I haven't been screwing it inside my head for weeks.

466,I can't fathom happiness. I can't comprehend what it feels to be happy.,"I feel like whatever moments I've had that made me ""happy"" were just distractions from my immense sadness. It's always been an on and off thing where there are instances where I feel stupid about my negativity, but then... embrace the negativity and once again, question whether I was ever truly okay. I'm so confused with myself.

I've been wanting to reach out to my university's health services to get some counseling over the phone because I can't get help under my parent's roof, but everytime I make plans to reach out, I just change my mind when the time comes. Suddenly, my mental state is not as bad and I feel ""fine,"" but a couple hours later, after the available time for counseling ends, I go back to this deep state of mental anguish and regret not getting help. But it just repeats itself over and over again and I'm just scared that when I do get a chance to talk with a professional, they won't truly understand the ""real"" part of me(?) and I won't actually get the right help?

There were times where I just tried to power through the doubt while I'm on the phone, but each time I always got an automated message like, ""we are currently experiencing a high volume of calls, please leave a message with your name and contact information..."" And I just don't leave a message because I'm scared.

Idk what to do. I don't want to bring this up to my friends or bf. That feels so lame and I don't want to depend on them for my own ""happiness."" I don't want to burden their summer vacation.",1654678657.0,1,1.0,2,0,v7kzji,t3

Although I still love her as she’s my mum but honestly it hurts me to say that if she wasn’t my mum I wouldn’t put up with her in my life because she makes it so miserable. 

My dad is fine, but again his attitude towards things and lack of organisation - which I’m aware is down to his own ADD problems stresses me out. I’m also convinced he had an affair which I can’t ever get out of my hear especially if he’s working late or out for the evening. To make matters worst my own therapist said that if you think he’s had an affair it’s probably true. Great to hear.. 

Long story short I’m struggling living with them but I’m saving for a house and wedding and renting will take a huge chunk of the savings I’m currently able to make each month.

It felt like being hit with a bag of bricks. 

Then, it just…stopped. I feel nothing. And I am, to a degree, used to feeling numb, it’s my most persistent symptom of depression. However, going from such an extremely low mood to nothing feels weird. I thought I’d feel some kind of way today, but I just don’t. I also am just trying to not think about it.

471,How to help my boyfriend,"I would like to start this by saying that I am diagnosed with anxiety and depression and have been dealing with it for years, so I understand!

Basically my boyfriend every few weeks or so would say that he feels weird. He doesn’t like to use the word depressed because he is insistent that he has no problem. Having depression myself, he does show signs of it during these random times. (Im not diagnosing him im just saying he acts as if he did) But I have no idea how to help him if he insists that he is fine. Like it’s to the point of getting into an argument. It’s not this alone that bothers me but he doesn’t do anything to stop this cycle. He says no to everything I suggest, and just ignores me because once again, “there is no problem”. 

He confuses me as he is so understanding and kind to me about my own mental health. 
He has said in the past that he has problems about needing to be the best and he feels insecure sometimes so that could be why he doesn’t admit it but its so hard to help him when he says no to everything I say, refuses to do anything to make himself feel better while also refusing that there’s a problem. 

It kind of annoys me, I know I have depression myself so it’s hypocritical and I feel guilty about being annoyed. I say encouraging and reassuring things, and he knows im always there for him unconditionally but he is always so blunt and just disagrees with everything. I dont know how to make him feel better if he refuses to acknowledge the problem, and doesn’t do anything to work on it. And its just going to keep on happening until he does and its been happening for years but every time he refuses to speak to someone because “it isnt a problem.”
Whats ironic is that he said the only time he’d ever be annoyed at me about my mental health is if i stopped trying.

I only try my best and take everyday as it is.

In a sense it is a good thing because I don't get hurt or disappointed as much anymore. I focus on what I could do because that's really the only thing I could control.

474,Can you have PTSD from a suicide attempt? **TRIGGER WARNING**self harm descriptions*,"When I was 22 I ordered 2 bottles of pills

 **I won’t be naming the type or concentration of the pills because I don’t want anyone getting ideas** 

off AmazonUS because they didn’t sell the pills in high concentration in Canada. I put them in the corner of my closet where they sat for a few months until I mustered up the courage to take one of the bottles ( around 60 tablets). I swallowed its contents with some water and sat in my closet with the door closed crying for 10 minutes. I had saved my suicide letter on my desktop and left my laptop open, it was titled “Dear mom”.

I then burst into a panic and ran to my bathroom in an attempt to vomit. I could not, so I called 911. I was taken to the hospital put on a drip and made to vomit the contents of my stomach, after I healed physically i got 51/50’d for only three days thank GOD. 

Lately I can’t stop thinking about it, I was so alone, I didn’t have any friends I could call, my mom came all the way to Canada from my home country to be with me so I’m grateful but coming from such a rural place and having older parents that are pretty old school meant that no one really pushed me to get help and I was kind of expected to just keep going on with life. 

My uni grad was delayed by a semester because I was in the hospital during 3 of my finals, the same day I got out I was emailing profs and department heads to have my tests rescheduled, however sadly I failed the retakes. I decided I would study really hard next semester and ended up graduating with honors 3 months late. I should have been proud but I was sad, something really scary had happened yet the world around me didn’t really react. 

Maybe that’s narcissistic and self absorbed I feel really guilty about it too, like it  signifies something sick in me, so many awful people have tried to kill themselves, was I coward and a menace like them? Who is to say my self hatred is unfounded?

These questions don’t leave me, neither does the feeling of cold air in my dark empty closet as I sat in it waiting to die.

I am 25 now and I am not sure I have reconciled anything within myself, nor am I sure that my living was a positive outcome. I was just being stupid, it was just a stupid insignificant moment yet It haunts me. 

So do you think something like this could cause ptsd? I know it’s not really traumatic but the memories pop into my consciousness and shock me, crying at work has become regular, I feel my emotions are bigger than my awareness of them.",1654686084.0,10,0.93,12,0,v7mw0m,t3
475,Done with people,"I'm done with people.

I had a bad childhood with unloving parents and one brother who used to spank me whenever he could (out of jealousy). I had several friends at school, but after entering college, I have never ever seen them again (despite sending messages to them). I was raped by my first boyfriend and met a couple of bad guys later on. I haven't had a great life.

In 2012, I went to Brazil for a one-year exchange student and met extremely helpful people and made lifelong friends. They are the kind of friends who stay through thick and thin. Unfortunately, I was not able to go back to Brazil since 2013.

In 2015, I went to India for a 6-month internship, in addition to being cheated on and manipulated by the guy I met there, I was groped by 2 guys while cycling back home from work.

Throughout the years, I have met hundreds of people, but I realized how selfish and self-centered people are, especially Europeans. They call you only when they need something from you. Otherwise, they have no consideration for you. Last year, I lived in a flat with another girl. She gave my name to the tax office (as per my country's regulations, I was not supposed to pay tax) so that I would have to pay half of the tax to be paid by her. Luckily I managed to handle the situation with the tax office.

I'm currently living with 4 Europeans. To make it simple, I am never invited to any trip or hangout (since the beginning). Apart from one girl, I am never offered food. I am hardly asked ""hey, are you doing well?"" even if I stay in my room all the time. I could be hanging myself and nobody would realize it. Yet, I've always shared the cakes I bake and make them taste the food I cook. At some time, there was a girl who was not feeling very well, and I would check on her from to time by knocking at her door and ask her how she was doing. We can't be friend with everyone, but I sometimes feel odd to think that this is the basic duty of every human being? Now I don't interact with anyone in the flat. I don't like doing it, but I'm tired of pretending that everything is good.

I don't have any emotional/financial support from my parents. In my hard times, I can only lean on these Brazilian friends I made 10 years ago and that live thousands of kilometers away.

You may suggest that I consult a health professional. Well, I consulted 3 psychologists when I was 15 and all of them only worked for money, nothing else. And a health professional is not going to change the world we live in.",1654685734.0,3,0.8,8,0,v7msfi,t3
476,I couldn’t do it,"I’ve been in a depressive state for around 3 or 4 months, and it was mostly caused by my lack of self-confidence and self-love, lack of motivation to do productive stuff and to work on myself, and several fights with my family.

Last week was probably my lowest point. I deleted my social media because I was done talking to people, I stood isolated in my room not doing anything, and even when I did get out of my room, I was getting in fights with my mom and my dad, for all the possible reasons they could find. This was putting a lot of stress on me and didn’t help me get out of my emotional state whatsoever.

I really couldn’t take all this anymore. A few days ago I went to a building so I could jump off it. But when I got on top of the building, I was just staring downwards for a while, and I wasn’t brave enough to jump so I went back home.

484,A Silly Self-Reflection on Myself,"I feel so weird, I am in a chronic state of battling between wanting to be emotional, and vulnerable to holding a hard/cold façade of indifference &amp; emotionless attire. In between these two states of mind I constantly go back and forth. If there are twelve hours in a day, I could confidently say I am plagued by thoughts of nihilism for six. My biggest problem, and despite my outer appearance of a life well managed, and a person well put together, my inner mind is screaming at the loneliness I feel. Those around me who hurt me without pity, nor compassion, damaged my will for connection, destroyed my trust in people, and companionship. When I meet someone I fall madly in love with, I feel apprehensive and scared. I trust only in my own thoughts, which from my world’s perspective, views others as enemies, attackers out to hurt me. I will watch/listen to hours of self-help material; I will exercise and work hard in my career. But at home, my bed is unmade and cold, my black desk holds items of no value, and the flowers I was given months ago have now died. I now only assume good things will shatter in my hands. I meet someone nice; I know it will not work out. Besides I attach myself onto others like a parasite in need of constant attention and affection. Il dream my way through days, and walk alone past midnight when life is asleep. I am constantly looking for peace in my mind. Depression has turned into thoughtlessness now, and as hopeful as I was years ago, today I am not so sure how to continue on. I have money, and attach value onto material goods to feel less lonely. My life is constant and boring. Whatever the case, these things cannot make up for the loss of humanity, the loss of your soul, and the constant loneliness that plagues you. Nothing will replace the touch of others, the assuring vulnerability of connection. Through this I say to others; focus not on regrets and opportunities that have flew past you, but the present connections you build with others. One day you look back, and you say to yourself how sad, that I could have had so much more.",1654680272.0,0,1.0,1,0,v7le3v,t3

488,no options left,"hi. im 20. things in life keeps getting worse and i dont think i have any other outs. its hard to stay positive and move forward. honestly the days blur together and i dont see a point in living. 

i called the suicide hotline, she pretty much told me to just try and sleep and not overthink. if it were that easy i would.

in sum, i got in a minor car accident in march, costing about $5k to fix which i have yet to do. ive been driving with one headlight. i lost my job a week after. i recently got a speeding ticket worth 6 points in a construction zone, so fines for that are high as well. i have my second court day at the end of june since i was one of the lucky few who didnt get a ea bargain for reduced points.

i dont even own a car. i use my moms since she works at home. i know she thinks im a disappointment. if i left im sure she could use my insurance money for something better.

i keep making dumb decisions.

i failed a couple classes at uni and currently behind in graduating. if i told my mom she would kill me and kick me out. i live with her as my parents are separated. shes been a control freak since my stepdad commited suicide when i was maybe 12 or 13. i find school pointless and too expensive. why waste my time stressing about studying when i could die tomorrow. i would’ve died without actually living to do anything.

i recently got in my first relationship, 2 months in today. i keep pushing him away. he treats me well but my depressive episodes make me shut him out. im sure he hates me too and he’s tired of me. i am worthless and he deserves better. is it selfish that i want to keep him. i try to be a better person for him but i get so scared. he currently isnt replying to me. i guess im that stereotypical crazy girlfriend. if he leaves i honestly think i would lose any sense of emotion in me.

i dont have any close friends. they are all in relationships and stopped talking to me a while ago. they are all fake, most have just wanted my money (when i had it).

i started cutting again and i want to push it further but i am scared if my mom sees. 

at this point i cant remember any other reasons to die.

503,I [27f] will never be ok with myself,"TLDR: The youth I never had will haunt me forever. 

Context: I was diagnosed with classical autism as a child and it basically ruined my life. Sure I was given early speech therapy intervention and seen as a ""lucky case"" for not being clinically retarded, verbal, and not spaced out 24/7 and inflicting self harm, my diagnosis was even changed to Aspergers (back when that term was still used by psychologists), but it still utterly wrecked my life.

I won't get into my pitiful and embarrassing life story even further, but the end result is I have no life, no friends, no hobbies, barely any education pass elementary school, and am here nearing 30 a fat ugly virgin. A female at that, even more impressively sad and rare.

Now, I've accepted for a few years that I will never be loved for who I am, I would seriously question the judgement and character of anyone who did. This wouldn't bother me so much if I at least was validated as a sexually attractive being, the kind of woman who gets catcalled no matter what she's wearing and can easily hookup with reasonably good looking average men. 

The problem is, not only was I cursed with extremely poor social skills both conversational and non verbal, I also had to be born a 3-4 that has repeatedly been mistaken as a guy in my preteen and teen years. Welp, since I can't control who I was born into being in the inside, I can at least change how I am on the outside right? Woops, on top of all that, I'm too poor to afford plastic surgery, a goal I've researched for myself and accepted I needed since my early 20s. 

I could have gotten a job maybe, but I've had so many bad and embarrassing experiences with people outside my family at school and in the general public. I've tried to avoid going out as much as possible for a good chunk of my life now, I don't need to endure any more humiliation if I can actively avoid it. Even without that I have terrible executive functioning, attention, and memory skills, I would be lucky if I ever kept a job longer than 1 week. 

So here I am, sad lonely and pathetic, a cautionary tale for anyone who wants kids. Someone who's starting to realize I'll never even have the basic human experience of a 20s lively sex and/or dating life, my face slowly aging and crushing the dream of being mistaken for 18-21. Someone who gets actively jealous and depressed of teenagers having sex lives. Realizing the fantasy of a youth and young adulthood with new experiences outside my bedroom, of being seen by others even if only as a pretty piece of meat instead of a freak to be giggled at as I pass by strangers, will never be. It will be something I will always be looking at through a rear view window getting farther and farther away, more unobtainable by the day.

511,Medication and Apathy,"About 4 months ago I started using Cerebral.  I got put on antidepressants (Bupropion/Wellbutrin), antianxiety (Buspirone/BuSpar), and an antipsychotic (Aripiprazole/Abilify) to make up for what my antidepressant was lacking.  Later on, because I was feeling so incredibly restless and empty from the Abilify, I got prescribed Clonidine/Catapres to help with those symptoms and further with my anxiety.  Eventually I just couldn't take the Abilify anymore, I stopped, hoping my enjoyment of things would come back...but it hasn't.  It's been about two weeks since I stopped.  I'm starting to wonder if Wellbutrin was contributing to the apathy.  Because I felt like I needed to do things when I was on Abilify, and while it was an unpleasant feeling, it was like lighting a fire under my ass to get up and go.  I'd do things just to relieve the compulsion.  But now I just feel like there's no purpose in life.  Things I used to enjoy still bring me no happiness, but the worst part is that without the Abilify it's like I can almost reach happiness, relaxation, comfort, etc, and I just can't cross those last couple of inches to get there.  At this point I can just sit in bed all day, sleep all day, and just get up for work, eating, feeding my pets, etc.  But all other free time is eaten up by...nothing, because I don't feel like doing anything.  The symptoms almost feel worse than before I started taking medication, because back then at least I could enjoy something in between the pain and exhaustion.  Does anyone have any experiences with these medications?  Is 4 months long enough to tell if something is working for you?  And does it sound to you like the medication isn't working for me, or that the dose just isn't strong enough?  I'm incredibly sensitive to medication and cutting a dose in half or doubling it can have completely unexpected side effects, as I found out while experimenting (with the doctor's consent) with dosage for my Abilify.

The reason I'm asking here is because my prescriber has acted somewhat annoyed with me needing so many appointments and medication adjustments.  But living like this feels like torture and it's like he doesn't understand that.  I am a very passionate and emotional person, and while I knew that it was to a heavy degree and self destructive pre medication, I didn't think my medication would completely deconstruct who I am and make it all feel meaningless.  I figured it'd just be more controlled and I just wouldn't cry hysterically because I saw a video of a three legged dog getting kicked out of a vehicle or something.  Pre medication it felt like a beautiful world that I couldn't participate in because of my own personal hell.  Now the world doesn't feel appealing at all.

I haven't felt emotionally numb since I first started dealing with severe depression in high school.  I've always been on the side of depression that is ""feel incredible, heart-wrenching pain and be emotionally unstable.""  But this emptiness on the flip side...I'd rather stop running into pitfalls wherever I turn.  It's just frustrating, and I'm tired.  And I go in and out of feeling hopeless.

PS  I am also getting counseling once a month.  I currently can't afford to get counseling more than that, and once I can I will be getting it once a week.  It could be that that's what I'm lacking, rather than the medication aspect of it all.  I'm just not sure altogether.",1654668530.0,1,1.0,3,0,v7ii0u,t3

514,Living in a softcore nightmare,"

I’ve been in a relationship for a year and it was rocky from the get go. 
I sped past all red flags because so many of the other vital elements in my life were unstable. 
I pushed my own boundaries to satisfy the other person, gave too much too soon, and isolated myself from friends, family and hobbies. 
My SO established the relationship parameters early, looked through my phone without my knowledge and then lied about their involvement with another person when I asked about their history after violating my privacy. 
As the relationship progressed into the 3rd month I made some grave mistakes in having a little too much to drink at very important events (nothing awful happened other than having to go to bed early.) Though I apologized profusely and gave all reasoning I could with the instability in other life aspects, I truly believe my SO stopped making an effort at that point and never truly forgave me. Furthermore, this became a tool in every argument moving forward: that my drinking was the cause of all our problems. I took this seriously and began to make changes. At the same time, the effort became so minimal on their part, I didn’t realize that I was organizing and initiating every time we saw each other.
I gave more and more, I accepted more and more acts of disrespect. 
I remember coming to a date night at his  place and he  didn’t want me to walk my dog around his building a certain route and I later learned that my he had met attractive women a few years younger at the pool who lived on that side of the building. He left me out of events because they were “boys only” when I learned later everyone’s SO was there.   
After trying for a month, I realized that I could no longer do anything right in this person’s eyes. When I got a new job, I was criticized for the fact that it was  with all males (common in my industry) despite the fact that I’d been miserable at my prev job and this was a great opportunity fiscally and career wise.  
When I stopped the drinking, other aspects quickly became a problem: doing small household chores while hanging out together, not being intimate enough after I’d had a much longer day/week than he had and usually overextended myself in that aspect. 
Then there was blame that I hadn’t introduced him to my family, and when I tried to make plans to do so, he always had a trite excuse for why he could not attend.
In the 7th month the fights escalated and the intimacy became so focused on him and the effort became so solely mine that I was at my absolute lowest when it came to my self esteem.  
I became even further withdrawn from my family, holding back tears at any inquiry into how I was doing. My co-workers noticed how withdrawn I’d become.  My friends said I was at the most unstable and miserable they’d ever seen me.  
Things came to a head during a day long pseudo breakup after another night of me expressing my feelings turned into him hanging up on me and me coming over because we couldn’t work through it.  

After that awful day and tearful conversations with my family. I decided I would make a clean break and written a letter when I was ready.  I’d learned that he was already on dating apps and was following  women from dating apps on IG.  
I quietly assumed it was over and had the most peaceful 4 days of my life. 
Then he reached out acting like nothing had happened.  

I’d speak to him when I could casually and he was surprised at how happy I sounded I stayed grounded and kind. Until he said I’d been distant and unfair and blocked me on all social media. This was hurtful because I’d felt there was a complete disregard for and erasing of our connection and relationship. At that point I chose to stop communicating. Over the next week I got phone calls, texts, letters, flowers, until he was at my house when I came home one night. I asked him to leave 5 times before agreeing to talk outside because I was exhausted from a 12 hour workday.  
I kindly listened to everything and was met with disdain when I refused to sit next to each other or have any physical contact while I listened. 
During this conversation he said he wanted a future, he understood me, he wanted to make an effort to make things right 
I tried again. Things were good for a few weeks before the same issues came up and the old pattern was back. 
Cut to one year in and things have escalated to physical violence, continued criticism of every aspect of my personality and humanity and now that drinking is out of the picture on my end, it’s other minuscule things that make it a chore to be with me. 
I’m not sure what kind of psychological research or masochistic experience I’ve been seeking in this relationship. What empathy I thought I could extend to understand this person and see them as the day I met them, or even the first few months. Or what cortisol I’ve been chasing to reenact my chaotic childhood but my mind, heart and body are tired and bruised. I’ve been clawing to get some balance back in my life. I don’t know what to do.

TL;DR I’ve been in a hard relationship for a year, trying more has led to more manipulation, I do not know what to do or how to even take the first step because my self esteem is so low",1654666896.0,3,1.0,3,0,v7i29p,t3
515,I want a family and I'm destroying myself by emotionally eating,"(vent to get it all out). I eat. Im 5ft 5in, 270lbs. I have a naturally big frame too. Everytime I'm upset, bored or even happy I eat. I'm not sure when it started, but I can remember even doing it when I was very little. It seems my depression started at very young age(probably 6 or 7). I was ignored a lot by family and everyone, my sister was the ""golden child"" who needed all the attention. I couldn't have anything of my own, without my sister out doing me. I've got no talent or hobbies, she'd make anything I do about her. It hurt that she had natural talent at everything too and I struggled. It hurt no one paid attention to me. There's like a hole I'm trying to fill and I can't. 

(Tw:miscarriage) 
I want a family of my own. I can't afford one. I can't find anyone to love me. I attract partners who want me to take care of them like a child. They have no jobs or are poor too. I'm almost 30. My time is running out. I want kids. I had lost one baby in 2020(birth control and condoms were used). I was looking at adoption for my baby, because I knew I couldn't afford to care for it. That destroyed me, and I ended up  miscarring. I feel like I was robbed. A sick joke the world was playing. I wanted it so bad, but I knew I couldn't keep it. Then losing it...... Doctor said if I had another I'd have to be on bed rest the whole time. What man would want to take care of me? I want to be a mom so bad, but I don't think it'll ever happen. I'm not pretty, low paying job, medical problems, live with my disabled mom. Yeah, no man thats decent will want to take care of me and have a family with me. 

I'm poor. I'm in the grey area. Make too much for government help, but too little to survive on my own. If I quit my my job and picked up 2 or 3 part time jobs, I'd probably make it. I need health insurance though. I have bad anxiety and other medical issues (heriated disc, carpal tunnel, bad foot). I live paycheck to paycheck. So I can't just quit for a new job and, wait for  the new paycheck to hit. By the time a new paycheck hit, I'd be behind on all my bills. Plus my current job takes all day and all my time. I've stayed at this low paying job so long cause I'm scared. Scared of not being good enough, of failure, of being homeless, of getting fire at a new job and not making it.

527,I have horrible dreams every f-ing night,"I've always had long, vivid dreams, and could recall them piece by piece the next morning, even days later. Since starting a new antidepressant, I've started having the same long dreams, but now they are terrifying. People die, sometimes I die, sometimes I'm the one doing the killing. Almost every one of my dreams has a reset, it goes back to the beginning so I can try to fix the mistake and set everything right before people get hurt. It doesn't always work. I wake up in cold sweat, screaming or moaning, heart racing, and on one occasion covered in tears (I thought my grandma was dead). What's worse is that these meds I'm on knock me out and I sleep heavily all through the night. I don't wake up unless something really scared me, but I just fall back asleep and into the same dream. I can't say I don't have good dreams, but they are a rarity. Like I said the dreams are vivid, so they feel just like real life. So flying in a dream feels, well, pretty awesome actually. I have lots of flying dreams, usually ending in plummeting but still, flying is cool. 

My superhero dreams are cinematic. My brain comes up with characters on the spot, and some existing characters too. And villains. I could write books on how crazy these dreams are, it's like Marvel quality. There's weapons and explosions and monsters and machines. Of course these dreams don't make a whole lot of sense so trying write it out would be useless. And they say dreams are a reflection of your waking life, so there's a chance I could be sued if the wrong character stepped into the wrong scene, if that makes sense.

Anyway I'm tired and I have to sleep soon. This time of night makes me scared. I never know what the next nightmare will be. Last night I dreamt about a lady being murdered in her hotel, but that lady was also a bad guy, so in the time loop where I try to save her, I end up letting her die anyway. My brain hurts just trying to make sense of it. Also I was graduating and getting married at the same time and my whole family was there. I think my subconscious is trying to tell me something. Probably to hurry up with my commitments.

535,"I'm a fucking loser weirdo and I feel like I'm in a hole, even if I don't have the right to feel like this.","I'm a 26 year old male. I'm lucky enough to have a job that allows me to live on my own without bothering anyone or asking for anything, even if it means I have to live far away from everyone I know and love. Not that there are a lot of people who I feel like that, I'm a loser after all :)

I met someone a while ago in an MMO (FFXIV), and we became quickly really good friends, and then we decided we wanted to get to know each other and maybe try to pursue something IRL. I was happy, I barely knew that person, but spending time with them made me happy like nothing else in my dull little life.

It didn't last long, because they soon figured he couldn't be with another male... Out of all reasons for someone to not be interested in me, having dumped because I'm a thing I hate fucking hurts, especially since I'd do anything to chop what is in between my legs off and to get rid of everything that makes me a ""male""... But I guess I'll always be a dude and there's no way around it.

We got together for a few hours a few days after we broke up, even if it didn't last.. I got told to not hold my life for them, but I believed in us, I believed he'd look back at all the times we were together, how happy it made him (because I did believe I made him happy), and figured it was okay, even if it came from an ugly thing like myself.

It didn't happen, and as time went on and things began to cool down, I did the obviously bad thing of keeping pestering them with my feelings. Every interaction we had ended up with me somehow making the subject ""us"", and I even reached out to them a few times just to talk about this. I was really scared they had moved on, I was scared I was the only one clinging to my feelings like this, and I still didn't understand it was about him and his orientation and not about myself (I figured if I was better, maybe he'd want me?).

Now not only are we not together, but I feel like I've pushed him away enough that he just hates me, that he just does the bare minimum out of politeness whenever we happen to meet, and even thinking about talking to him feels like a mountain, I feel so out of place. It hurts so much, to have someone you love so much think of you as nothing but a nuisance, to have someone who you enjoyed talking to so much just not engage with you at all (I suck at talking to people, but talking to him always felt nice and easy... Now, the last few times I tried to talk to him, I consider myself lucky at all if I get a reply).

I fucking hate myself. I've been ""single"" now for longer than we've been together, and I'm still feeling the same (if not worst). I'm a fucking loser who has conditioned my happiness to someone else, someone else I can't have and who I can't make happy, but... Life doesn't feel the same without them. I constantly think about him, there's not a day where I haven't thought about him, there isn't a day where I haven't dreamed about waking up to him messaging me and we getting close again, and there isn't a day where I don't hate myself for have being an insensitive fuck who made the person I love a complete stranger to me. I know it's not happening... I'm an ungrateful asshole, I have people who care about me and who sometimes listen to me vent and cry (even if I've been making an effort to not vent as much anymore), but they don't feel enough to me.

I have trouble finding the energy to do even the basic stuff a lot of days, I'm so tired, even if I haven't been doing a whole lot, I wish I wouldn't exist, to be honest (I don't have the courage to actually hurt myself, though, because I'm a coward on top of every other bad thing I have going on about me). And I really don't think I have any right to feel like this. Why am I feeling like this over someone I met online? Why am I feeling like this after months? Why can't I just move on?

I'm a broken person, and knowing that only makes me despair and break even more, because there's no way in the world a broken person like myself could make him happy (or anyone else, even if I only really want to make him happy).

I hate myself. I'm mentally ill or something, am I not?

Edit: I managed to take a nap, and reading this makes me feel like a massive, walking red flag :) I really don't know what to do, or what I want with my life anymore tbh...",1654661992.0,1,0.67,1,0,v7goq9,t3

Things like that became more frequent and soon the ACT was coming up, I was very stressed I cried everyday as the date came closer.

545,Do I have any hope?,"19M, recently finished first-year of college.

I failed four courses. I have no solid reason to support these failures other than a ""lack of motivation"". The said courses were highly relevant to my major, so I am now trying to get help from the faculty in order to change my program.

I have always had an issue with procrastination and getting quickly demotivated with things that are of little-to-no interest to me. This only got worse after the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. I cannot seem to take sufficient action for things as important as my education and getting a job.

I've wasted thousands of dollars of my devoted and supporting parents' money. We have had many discussions and they keep mentioning that it is an issue with my mindset rather than my abilities. I agree with this, but I am not sure when or how I can change my mindset. I've been telling them I will change and that I want to try harder, but perhaps I've been lying to them and maybe even to myself.

If I cannot change, I fear that I will continue failing and disappointing them, and that I may try to hurt myself. I want to succeed, but I fear for my future.

Because somedays he won't have any breathing issues but other days he will have a COPD flare up where he has a really tough time getting back to somewhat normal. Plus my dad does have some dependence issues, that he worries if I'm not close to him. It just gets to me that all we ever talk about is him leaving this world and thats how its been for about 10 years. But now more then ever he dwells about leaving this world and thats what gets me down because I want him to feel better. But right now body is a wreck from the constant emotional roll coaster.

579,It's getting very hard!,"Day by day it's getting harder and harder for me to survive the whole 24 hours of the day. If i analyze my time to see in which time periods i am happy then there is 0 hours. I wake up to nightmares. I wash up crying and vomiting in the morning. I lose my appetite for breakfast. I get ready praying this world to end. I attend my classes with full of sleep anxiety with not a single word of knowledge going into my head. I do lunch alone as i have no friends ,all of them ditched me. On my way back home i pray that may  some accident occur to me. I came home with empty house heavy feet mentally and physically so much exhausted that i just wanna die in my sleep. In evening i try to study hard with my head being a total messed up place. At night it becomes more lonely and heavy at that time i want to talk to somebody so bad, i just wanna hug them and cry and scream my heart and problems out.

I am trying to fill out a trauma workbook for therapy and this chapter is about dissociation. The question was asking me where I go, what I feel in my body, and what part of me is still present. I realized the only part of me that was still present was my inner child. The question then asks, ""Where do they want to go?"" The answer is home. My inner child wants to go home. I used to feel this fairly frequently as a kid but I would always be home. For context, I moved around a lot so I never had a place that truly felt like home.

589,I've been so alone and the people I've met have just made it worse,"I have no one I can talk to - at all. No family or friends. And I've tried so hard to meet new people and build connections but my experiences have been so overwhelmingly negative it only made me feel worse about myself and my life. 

I don't know how true hermits do it. I want to feel okay with being so alone in the world but it's hard and scary. At the end, no one thinks about me or cares about me or would notice if I was dead. It doesn't feel free. It feels like pressure because every single thing I do is so important and I can't make mistakes or I set myself so far back. There's no one that cares enough I could even vent to. 

Theres a few times I've misread being polite for actual desire to talk to me and it hurts. Theres no therapy to fix this - I think when it gets this far, most people choose to end it. But I guess I keep misreading the situation and thinking maybe it can get better when my true trajectory is even worse than where I am now. 

All of the people who have sincerely treated me badly lived and continue to live better lives than I'll ever know. There is no inherent reward for doing good but being able to sleep soundly at night. In life, the people that harmed me will have been rewarded for doing so while I sit and rot, both barely surviving but never close enough to death. 

Everyday I wake up and think today will be the day someone will really try to reach out to me, maybe someone who's already known me and built the necessary empathy to do so now. I check my hidden and obscured inboxes periodically but there's never anything but spam and advertisers.

I love to watch people succeed, but it pains me to see how everybody has nice cars, nice houses, and is always doing something because I know that it will take a miracle for me to be like those people. I honestly look up to everyone as super-humans for just doing all of those things and not being phased by it. The whole world moves on while I just drown by myself. I feel like I can never be who I want to be no matter how hard I try. I always see myself homeless in the future and that will be worse because homeless people are not treated as relatable human beings. I feel like I am being punished for no reason with this. I feel so isolated and I just want to disappear into another reality because I can't take the reality I am living in. I really just want to die so that I can reincarnate as someone who has a chance. I sometimes wonder if it is just my depression that makes me look like a failure or if it is just me being some childlike piece of crap. I feel like I'm going to let both myself and everybody down.

All 3 of us have sons who are 3 and 2, so it's nice to have continued on to motherhood with them.

I have this major concern that me and my son (3) are going to be left out of things eventually.. I am just used to it. I have this stupid fear that my son and I will be last thoughts regardless of how my friends have made it clear that will never happen.

And I'm sure some even take these posts and place them in another sub just to have a good laugh. I have no problem talking about these things if it's a personal conversation but yeah I forget every mother fucking person has an ability to look into my soul when I'm completely open or they make an assumption of my soul and that is also left out for every mother fucking body to see.

Basically what the title says. The last thing I remember is it was Christmas. I remember going to my now ex's family's house for Christmas dinner.

I don't remember New Year's. I don't remember my birthday in March, what I did, what kind of cake I had, I don't remember my best friend's birthday in April.

I kind of remember the Ukraine war starting, because that's been traumatizing as fuck.

Everything but a loving family and a partner. 

My family just hate each other and have expressed several times that I’m sick in the head for being a lesbian. There is no one I can call when I feel down other than two very good friends that are tired of me and my negative thinking; understandably.

I fell for someone who used me to ease her own pain and pretty much invited me to get out of her life without blinking when things got complicated. As always, it’s me caring and people easily making selfish choices to avoid “a headache”.

What’s the point of having money and material things if you have no one to love and to share it with.

What’s the point of staying alive knowing that all I have ahead is a life of ups and downs. Since what I need the most, a family, is out of my reach and control.

I feel like my ego keeps me going - I know my potential and what I can achieve, I’m relaxed about my persona and how I act around people like I don’t try but yet I’m a ‘cool’ guy who’s original and different, and that makes me think oh I’m not like everyone else so therefore I do have some purpose, but we all end up in the same place, I know I’m equally as unimportant and important as everyone else

608,"I'm trapped in my own thoughts, nothing ever makes sense and there's no future for me","I was reading my old vents from a while ago and for some reason it made me really depressed, just something about comparing to my current perspective to the way I used to think, seeing how I already felt terrible back then and now it's gotten even worse. Especially the one I wrote around a year and a half ago, in fall 2020, some things that I tried to ‘warn’ the future me about, yet I still didn’t listen, because as if I wanted it all to get worse, just as everyone wants me to. And they try to convince you to change, because then it’s going to get “better” - and no one fucking gets it when I say that’s exactly what I don’t want, because don’t you see? If I change, I won’t be myself anymore, I will be another brainwashed number in the system, without thinking twice about it. Because it’s “help”, and because this is what they do to people, make things get worse and worse until you can’t stand it anymore, when you’d willingly remove all your thoughts and opinions just for a peace of mind, for it all to finally stop, because distractions are just distractions that eventually don’t work anymore, and if I could I’d take pills and get drunk all the time, just to forget about reality, - but isn’t that the same, just in a different way? Forgetting reality, becoming unaware, losing your identity, but then again, what even is real or not, is there any real universal truth or is everything just the matter of perception? 

And I’ve already wrote to myself about this, many times, yet still haven’t been able to reach a conclusion, because I’m too lost in my mind to ever achieve or understand anything. My thoughts are incomprehensible, I can't find a way to express myself, it all just makes me even more frustrated, because words are just words, and everyone who tells me they can understand me is a liar, because it's impossible to ever truly understand someone, isn't it? They can read, they can hear me, but no one else can *feel* it, and it's driving me insane. And nothing ever makes sense, and nothing helps, and there’s nothing I can do about it, and all this helplessness I can do nothing about, yet I still keep complaining. I can't find a way to relieve the immense frustration I'm feeling, it's inescapable and all-consuming. I can't get rid of the deep loneliness and alienation I feel, it's not something that can be fixed by talking to people, because it's not just about the lack of social interaction, it's the self-awareness and knowing I'll never belong anywhere, out of place wherever I go.

No one gets it, how am I supposed to live in a world where there’s no escape? This one quote, “I will sooner die than betray my own thoughts” really stuck with me, because I do think like this, essentially a lot of my ‘philosophy’ or whatever simplified into one sentence; and that’s exactly what’s bothering me the most right now. Is there anything in life that’s actually worth living for? I can’t even describe the way I’m feeling. Once again, I’d rather just forget everything, take something to make me unable to think. I’m tired of asking myself all these questions I know I’ll never get an answer to, - it will only stop once I’m dead, but I can’t even decide about that, because once again there’s so many options to choose from, and I don’t mean just methods; in a way I want to be forgotten like I’ve never existed in the first place, but then again it just doesn’t feel right, because why do I have to go through all this just for it all to end like I’ve never even been here?

Venting is as useless as screaming at a wall, no one ever sees my posts anyway, and no one fucking **gets** it, sometimes I wonder if I'm the only one who's truly real.

Couldn’t deal with my second year of college so I’m starting afresh next year and working part time for the time being as it’s all I feel I can manage at this moment. When I left college, I just felt this overwhelming sense of self hate but I feel like I’ve always had a huge issue with myself. I feel I’ll always find a way to fail.

I love soccer and play for a club but I take it really seriously, so seriously that I struggle with confidence and constantly feel like my teammates are judging me behind my back.

611,I feel so done. I'm so tired of being sad and tired of being tired. I don't know what to do anymore.," I have reached a point where I am just so embarrassed by being who I am. At this point, I would consider myself a loser. Dating has been hard for me for quite some time and online dating is brutal. I hate going on it as it's hard for me to pick people by pictures as I like to make a connection first but work from home and my shyness has prevented me from having confidence. I am 25 years old and I have only had one girlfriend in my life that did not last too long I have only kissed two girls in my life and am still a virgin. I am embarrassed being a 5'5 male, which really makes online dating even harder for me. I have been told I am too short, too nice, and unattractive to date. I recently went on a diet and treated going to the gym, I was 195LBS at the start of March and now I am down to 175-177LBS as of today (June 7th) but my weight has been stuck for three weeks and I feel so defeated. On the dates I do make I either get stood up, they go on their phone the entire time, or they are so boring to talk to it's like pulling teeth.

I am stuck in this cycle of being depressed because I always get told I can't act this way, and I am always good at hiding it, but I can never share my feelings or open up because ""it's unattractive"". No wonder why no one wants to date me.

As for my job, it pays well and there are amazing people there who treat me so well, but I have developed work depression. I am stuck doing IT which I don't enjoy. I want to be creative and do screenwriting. I personally believe I am a very strong and talented writer and won a scholarship a few years back for my writing sample but I have been so depressed for a while that I have lost my motivation to write and it's been two years I don't feel like I will be good at it anymore. It's such a tough industry to get into that I feel like I will never have a chance anymore.

I don't know what to do anymore. I feel like I have disappointed myself and my family. I just don't know what to do anymore.",1654643304.0,1,1.0,3,0,v7akjt,t3
612,therapist parents and struggling with therapy,"when i was growing up my mom was earning her masters in psychology. i learned a lot alongside her as i was used for demonstrations and often told about what she had learned in her classes. every day now after her sessions, she vents to me about her frustrating clients and what methods she uses to deal with certain people as a therapist now herself.

for the most part these things have been positive. for someone who grew up with mental illnesses/disabilities and around people with the same, it's been helpful to be emotionally mature through direct teaching like this and a mom who knows how to navigate a brain. 

but now that i feel i need my own therapy, it feels impossible. those first few sessions make me feel like I'm burning. it's just like talking to my mom when she's trying to reassure me. i know why they're saying what they say. this is their job. and i place full trust in them already- i do not care to gain a relationship with the therapist because i know, again, it's the job. i am perfectly content just dropping my current struggles onto the therapist and them telling me the applicable methods to assist myself and we go on our ways. but there is so much fluff to the process. i get it. people are adverse to just dropping their trauma on someone and have trust barriers with that. and they often do not believe that therapy works or that the methods are meaningless. i don't think that! i do not need my barriers broken down! i know that legally therapists cannot disclose information and that they are systems of help. so i am content sitting down and telling them everything off the bat.

but instead i have to play this game of building a relationship i do not care for. it feels so pretentious speaking about it that way, but after witnessing my mom treat her therapy as a career and job as it is for years i just cannot get over the mental hurdle of caring about treating my relationship with a therapist as anything more than what it is. 

i don't know how to get over this or if its possible to find a therapist that understands. i'm so frustrating having tried therapy several times but having to drop out so soon because it just makes me so upset and anxious every time a therapist tries to back me up and ease me into things or ask about things like my interests or my day that just don't pertain to my issues. and i feel like an absolute ass for feeling this way, but i can't help how much i shut down when a therapist uses lines that my own mom did to me that i know were read from the same textbook. it's hollow. i don't mind hollow, but i just want to be upfront about it. the only way i feel like i could connect and see a therapist as person and not someone within a job role is if they acknowledged that fact too and spoke to me like i'm not ignorant of that. 

uggggggh. i feel like I've implied people who are helped by therapy to be ignorant or for therapists to be hollow or whatever and i don't mean to say that. my experiences are not universal and i know it's a problem with *me*. but god please someone else relate to me and understand at least where i'm coming from even if i'm in the wrong somehow. i want to be helped by therapy so badly and i want to stop thinking this way or find a therapist who can work with me.",1654643181.0,4,1.0,5,0,v7aj4o,t3

I'm surrounded by friends and I'm living with family that to an extent understands that I'm struggling. but when i achieve ""happiness"" i am filled with dread. speaking to friends fills me with dread. hanging out with them and talking about my interests fills me with dread. i had a job for a few days that got me on a consistent schedule and out of the house but i've never wanted to be dead more for the 11 days i lasted there. I'm off summer right now for college and when i go back i have friends and people who invite me to parties and eat dinner with me but all of those things fill me with, you guessed it, dread. i don't desire socialization and nobody seems to understand. the joy i find in life currently is best found when i am alone. i wonder if it's self destructive but forcing socialization only crushes me more. i miss my friends. they're all there for me and they love me and support me but to speak and communicate is torture. 

i know that to get out of this hole i *need* to push myself. i need to enable routine and getting out and socializing. but being busy and social causes me to pass out from exhaustion any time i come home. i lose all the things i still value- that is, the hobbies i hold in my alonetime. 

but even if it was correct to spend all my time alone, it's barren and empty here too. days cycle forever and besides I need to work to survive and my time is running out on that front. life is dreadful and alonetime is at least numb, but i'd rather just be okay. 

i feel fucked up. my girlfriend- the only person i am never exhausted speaking to and love dearly- and i are in an open relationship. she has a lovely partner who i am meeting shortly. i have no interest in pursuing any other relationships at this time. nothing about this arrangement bothers me in any way, but i have been told by friends that they would kill themselves if they were me due to my relationship. exasperated that i don't desire more. that my girlfriend must be using this in a way to cheat because it's ""not mutual"". i don't really care or let this affect my relationship since i trust my girlfriend obviously, and i know the harsh things said are simply rude, but what does it mean about me as a person? why can't i handle or desire more relationships and socialization than a single person? will i be eternally cyclically depressed because i prefer personal routine? i don't understand. i have been called boring more times than i can count by family and friends and so much more. i don't know what to do. i want to experience joy in the way that others do.

619,My child looks like me and it annoys/saddens me,"Hello, my name is Lucas, I am 22 years old. My son is called M\*\*\*\*\* and is 1 year and 2 months old. My wife is called S\*\*\*\*\* and is 18 years old.

&amp;#x200B;

At first my statement may seem like a bad or inattentive father, but what annoys me about my son is that everyone says he looks a lot like me.

Commonly walking with him on the street or in public events always associate him with my image. in terms of appearance and personality. Even being a baby, it is actually very possible to discover the similarities between the 2 of us. We are like a walking DNA test. Skin, hair, eyes, legs, simplicity. Even my pictures as a baby are identical to his.

&amp;#x200B;

Actually... This worries me a lot, I've had a very difficult life for being the way I am. From the moment I entered the school, I was bullied until I left it. I was never good at sports, or with girls, I was never the trickster or the shrewd. I was always the silly young man who got beaten up by others in and out of class. My lunch money was stolen and I never learned to defend myself because I was always afraid of hurting others.

&amp;#x200B;

Looking at my son I can say that he will be at least like that. You know, as a father I want the best for my son, but looking at him I can see that he had suffered a lot of what I suffered if not even more...

&amp;#x200B;

Even my legs, my legs are bowed inwards, as a child I was bullied for the way I walked... I was bullied just for walking. Not even mentioning when I ran and everyone laughed and laughed at my face... And my son, just like my father and me, has the same legs, bowed inwards... And I have no idea what what to do imagining what he will go through in the future... As an anxious person undergoing treatment for depression I am completely lost...

&amp;#x200B;

There is nothing in this universe that I love more than my son... Nothing... And looking at him I don't know how to help him... My son's biggest game nowadays is kissing my wife's face dozens of times....

&amp;#x200B;

Before when he did that I smiled and played with him, but today whenever my baby kisses me, I cry with fear of what his innocence will cause...

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want nor will I teach him to be different, much less mean, I want him to be himself! But I'm terrified to see him suffer...

&amp;#x200B;

A week ago I joined Jiu-Jitsu in a public academy in the prefecture to try to learn some self-defense and serve as an example for my precious baby... But honestly I'm so scared... I've spent nights awake while my wife sleeps praying to God and asking for wisdom and blessings for my son... I wouldn't mind having to die for him to live, I just want him to live well and be happy.

&amp;#x200B;

But I'm afraid that because I look so much like myself, I'll end up a financially, emotionally and dependent on medicine to live...

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want him to be better than me, or even worse. I want him to be different from me... To live a life without crying as much as I cried, without trying to kill himself several times and without waking up every day and sleeping every day hating himself....

Ever since I was a kid that hasn’t worked for me. I tried natural supplements for energy and motivation but they do nothing for me. It feels like my muscles are made of jello and every second I’m at work I’m thinking about how I’d rather die than come in again the next day.

636,My understanding of my depression (can anyone relate?),"Perpetuate failure had haunted my soul. It seemed as though every worthy opportunity that I desperately strived for, ended in defeat. My heart grew quite bitter, envious, and resentful as weeks passed. And though I could hide my true perceptions of utter contempt, embarrassment turned me into a liar that hopelessly craved the admiration and attention of others. Unfortunately my brain was too cognizant to recognize insincerity, I wanted to feel something genuine. I felt as though I had truly despised sympathy, a detriment only to mask my inherently hypocritical nature. I had preached the notion that “allowing misfortune to take credit for our shortcomings wasn’t going to relieve the pain of the past or conceive a hopeful future ahead”. I believed that telling others how I was truly feeling, and becoming openly vulnerable would only lead to them expressing shame towards myself. When In actuality, only I was truthfully disappointed in myself. I punished myself the most because I had believed that I was destined for glory, and when the verdict of mediocre had continually invaded my state of mind, my self esteem began to rapidly deteriorate. And I was not as brave, resilient, or even as special as I had formerly believed. Sometimes I’m hopeful that life will take a turn towards authentic happiness, and for short while, it does! But then something as small as a  minor setback often leads to a vivid and foretold past that I can never escape. It’s like the light at the end of the tunnel suddenly dissipates, the surroundings mold into pitch black and the walls begin to reverberate. I can feel my grip on reality slowly suffocate, a dire torment no man can bear to face.",1654636659.0,0,1.0,1,0,v77zi9,t3

638,28M I've wasted my life,"I wish I was so much better than I actually am and I'm disgusted with myself that I do shit like write on reddit at 28 years old. But seeing as I have no friends because most people are snakes and just stabbed me in the back and I don't really socialize with people because I'm usually just the target of some sort of passive aggressive cutdown that makes me wanna fucking get out of there before I get pissed off anyway. It has been years since I've met anyone who I would actually want to hang out with for a prolonged period of time and who doesn't eventually show their true colors to be putting me down to make themselves feel better, straight up lying, or talking about me behind my back. 

I never finished college so I'm here at this age doing menial labor for twelve bucks an hour, the latest in a long strand of minimum wage jobs. I've been living with my parents since Corona started and I feel like an absolute loser. I'm trying to grow up and become a strong person but I always compare myself to other guys and it usually just comes down to who is more socially dominant and aggressive at least when sexuality and ""getting girls"" comes into the picture. I was never a jock and I was never socially dominant by nature. Which by the way is big on my mind because somehow I've made it to this age without ever getting laid or having a girlfriend. I was anorexic when I was 17 and I think somehow it fucked up my endocrine system and basically I'm just a relatively un hairy and young looking 28 year old which means a lot of girls are gonna pass me up and do already because they like guys who are ""all man"". Or maybe this shit is just in my fucking head I dunno. I used to get bullied a lot and to an extent I still do but these days I just avoid the situation because I have impulses toward violence now and there's already enough fucking hate and bullshit going on in the world. 

I just hate the feeling that I'm wasting my life and yet I am unable to increase my own value or become someone who anyone wants to get close to, just a beast of burden made for working and dying and without any form of affection or joy in my life. Nothing makes me happy anymore and I don't know what I'm going to do. My folks are 65 and I've completely failed them by being in this place in life and I guess what it comes down to is just that no one showed me how to be a man. Buy a fucking gun, shoot a bear, beat your chest, be a man, or at least a man in western society and if you don't do certain shit you just get labeled a soyboy. Not that I care but it sure seems to affect the getting laid aspect when everyone is running this narrative that you're a pussy.",1654636303.0,23,0.96,41,0,v77u2w,t3

My first suicide attempt was in November 2021 i was in the kitchen and grabbed a knife and just as i was about to stab me i overthinked it all. The only reason I am here writing this is because I thought back then that my friends at school would be really sad especially my best friend and even though I am going to therapy now I still feel depressed and not only because I feel so useless but also because I am lonely. I don't have many friends and only talk to them in school, the only person I talk privately to is my best friend. I just want to get a girlfriend but only to talk and cuddle because that's the only thing I want and need. But there is one problems I am overweight ( that was one of the reason I got bullied) and I really tried many diets and in all of them the first two days were really easy but then the third day came and I didn't even realize that I failed the diet.

I’m doing well professionally and finally moved out of my parents house and other things that should be positive but none of it seems to be affecting me in any way.

None of it matters anymore. I don’t know what to do or where to turn. I really tried but I’m worse than I was at my lowest point, and I’ve attempted suicide years ago. I really don’t have anything to live for anymore. So I don’t know what to do anymore.

646,My brother called me lazy,"I work hard, I have two jobs and I started school again. My brother (23) and I (26) were talking about some opportunity for work. He said something that triggered me - he called me lazy and I went off the handle. 

He justified this by saying he literally “watched me stay in bed for 2 weeks”. Now I haven’t done this in a long time but I remember when I was so horrendously depressed, all I did was contemplate suicide and they only way out of it was to sleep. I slept in my bed for two weeks and barely did anything. 

I yelled at him and told him “that wasn’t laziness that was…” and I couldn’t even finish the sentence because I realized it didn’t matter. He’d chalk it up to being lazy and feeling sorry for yourself. 

I feel like his words are so insensitive and cruel sometimes. Everyone’s depression looks different, and different people have different reason for being depressed. I felt so inadequate and then stupid because a giant fight happened over the word “lazy”.

648,Hypersexualizing myself to cope with OCD theme,"I (M19) have found an unhealthy coping mechanism. Since I was 9 years old I have been suffering of OCD. Two years ago I finally got diagnosed with this horrible disorder, after I got panic attacks about religion and existential topics. It was a horrible time with COVID making you question your mortality and that of your loved ones, while struggling to finish high school. Luckily I quickly received treatment, because I was 17.

Now I have been put on a waiting list as I am officially an adult. The OCD is back in the form of POCD. I am a closet gay man who has always lusted after ‘daddies.’ Basically bearded men who are bigger and more masculine than I am. I watch porn with older men. I have a crush on an ambitious guy in his mid-20s. Heck, when I was a child I crushed on actors who were in their 40s lmao. And I still regularly do. Yet my stupid fucking brain makes me think I’m a pedo.

The thoughts get so intense at night that I’m questioning my whole identity. I also feel this pressure to come out to my unaccepting family, to prove the world I am a gay man who can finally be in a healthy relationship with one of the countless men who ask me out.

But also to prove myself that I’m not a pedo. It’s a common theme in OCD sufferers, yet hugely stigmatized, which is why I’m debating to ask for help. My family is loving, but regressive when it comes to mental health and I expect them to be especially with this theme. I have no one but myself.

To cope I flirt with every gay man I see. I love the attention they give me. Also on the internet I do the same by posting sexual stuff about me and it’s gaining traffic. All this to prove me to myself, while I have never had the desire of a pedo.

I am happier outside when the sun is shining, when I’m at uni, when I’m surrounded by family or just shopping. I love being distracted. At night, it’s me and my thoughts. My mom comforts me, but she doesn’t know why.

The OCD is making me feel so depressed and anxious. I am thinking of asking for meds. They apparently lessen the severity of this disorder. I don’t know how to cope anymore.",1654633150.0,0,0.81,3,0,v76hat,t3

658,How do people manage to go to work (or just outside generally) during depressive episodes?,"Hi all, hope this type of post is okay here. I’ve been falling apart at the seams for quite a while, and unfortunately my depression seems to be worsening despite other conditions (PTSD) reducing in severity. It was different during the lockdowns: people were indoors all the time, depending on mostly delivered goods, social interaction was minimal, etc. I guess I got used to the (relative) ease of not needing to be functional because no one really saw me anyway.

It’s been really difficult to transition back into having to go outside and be presentable so frequently. I haven’t been able to go to work in several days simply because I don’t have any clean clothes left (haven’t done laundry). When I’m eventually harassed (live with parents) into having a shower, I have to order clean underwear/loungewear online so that I have something clean to change into. And recently I get so overwhelmed with the endless piles of clothing - clean or otherwise, they’re all mixed up - that I throw them away just so I don’t have to deal with the mess or stress. Clearly this is unsustainable in every sense of the word…

Now that I have to go to work regularly again, the need to get some kind of order in my life is more pressing than ever. I don’t want to be fired and I’m running out of excuses as to why I “can’t come into the office”. (I can do my job from home but they want me there physically because life is suffering I guess). I can’t afford to buy the amount of clothing needed to keep living like this. 

My health is suffering because wouldn’t you know, every microbe in existence loves when you don’t clean yourself or your living space. Again, more money wasted because I gave myself this or that infection and now I need to pay for treatment. I also have 4C hair and I guess I’m reaching that point where I have to actually do something to it now, yet another thing I’m dreading. As if I need 6 hours of agonising detangling, painful blow drying, and styling on top of my mental agony…

I know I’m not alone in facing problems in doing things during episode, so I was hoping to hear if anyone had ideas to share. At this point I’m willing to try any coping mechanism.

660,I am trapped between different paths that will both eventually lead to the same ending.,"TW: Venting about most of my life, depression, ADHD, s**cidal thoughts, self-h**m, LGBT+ erasure 

Both my physical and mental health are in smithereens. My parents are telling me everyday to just give up on school and my future. I can't even attend school anymore, I think I missed more than half of the whole number of classes this year, and yes I should have been expelled long ago if I didn't have exemption papers from the hospitals I've been spending whole months into and my psychiatrist, whom, although gave me exemption papers, doesn't take me seriously and doesn't want to give me the ADHD diagnosis I need, which, with medication, would probably solve at least a part of my problems, or at least calm the mental torment I go through everyday telling myself I'm faking it and deserve the way life is treating me right now — about why I believe I have ADHD, I've read multiple scholarly articles on it, and even papers issued by the biggest hospital in the capital city of my country, I'm sure if I went there I would have an easier time but I'm stuck in the opposite end of the country; not only that but I've discussed with several people whom have been diagnosed with it and reached the conclusion that I most likely have it, but they were all living abroad and had no idea how sh.tty the medical health care system is here, even though I live in """"Europe"""". (spoiler alert, it's Romania, which is fundamentally different from France, England, Portugal, Sweden, etc). I don't even want to start telling about how my """"therapy"""" sessions with my """"psychiatrist"""" go, she's told me I'm trying to fake ADHD, that I do all the fidgeting I do and say all the things I say deliberately. I've had a severe depression diagnosis ever since I was 12, and she's doubting that one as well. I've lived a life where I've been forced to smile and laugh it off when I wanted to cry and scream. And therefore, she's told me multiple times ""I see you're smiling, so that surely means things aren't as bad as you make them seem"". I even opened up about being verbally abused by my mother, and she said ""that's not that bad, all mothers say things that are """"""""a little mean"""""""" from time to time"", and even after my mother openly admitted she insulted me and degraded me almost every day, she said ""it's not that bad, you're just making it seem worse than it is"". And possibly even worse, despite accusing me of faking ADHD she's even told me ""ADHD is an illness that you can just look at the person and see they have it, you don't look like you have ADHD so therefore you don't have it"". I've been crying myself to sleep almost everyday ever since I was like 11, and if anyone still doesn't believe I have ADHD and my psychiatrist is right, my primary school teacher can testify I have it. She used to point out signs every single day, and she even told my parents how I acted, but somehow never told them I might have ADHD and they never linked the dots because they seriously don't even know what ADHD is. I asked them, and they had absolutely no idea what I was talking about. I tried to explain it to them but they just don't seem to care. Even in kindergarten I showed signs, if I sit to think about it it's been this way all my life but nobody ever cared. I even spoke to a few people from Romania about mental health and they said that their therapists meet their needs, it's almost as if I'm cursed. I've been to countless different psychiatrists and psychologists since I was 12 and until now (I'll be 19 in just a couple of days, this would probably be the worst birthday I've ever had, not that I've ever had happy birthdays, especially not since after I turned 10 years old) and when I say countless I don't mean 6 or 7, I mean a number that goes well in the 20s, and all they ever did seems to be making me feel worse. Everyone I've ever seen would either kick me out if I started crying, say that asexuality and being transgender (I am a ftm asexual) are either wrong or not real, that I haven't ever had s*x and so I can't know if I like it or not (although I once I did have s*x, and I told them about the trauma it left on me on long term, and they said ""well it was with a girl so that doesn't count, let a guy penetrate you and then tell me you don't like it"") and if I do like s*x men then I can't be trangender. Most of them just would tell me to shut up after a while or would end the session before time if I started to stutter or couldn't find a way to answer a stupid question they asked me, or told me to control myself whenever I started fidgeting, or didn't care to hear me out or even blamed myself for my dad being an alcoholic (his father is also an alcoholic, all his childhood he's been beaten by his mother, his teenage years he spent in a school full of rich kids who bullied him for being poor and skinny, and his first few years of afulthood after he married my mom when he was 21, his mother and sister would tell him off everyday saying he's made a huge mistake marrying my mom and that she doesn't deserve him because she's stupid, his mom would pamper his sister and her husband because they were both ""smart"" as opposed to both my mom and jim being ""stupid"", (his sister eventually got divorced and hasn't remarried ever since, while my dad and mom are still together and staying no matter how hard things get between them), my mom told me that whenever the two couples came to my dad's parents to eat, she would even save the chicken breast for my father's sister and her husband, and only give my father and her bones and skin. After all of that, he's been overworking himself everyday for over 30 years now, 26 years he had been working in a factory and the rest until present he's been working in a restaurant for his cousin, and his cousin has been paying him minimum wage for doing the work of 20 different men (he's a ""manager's assistant"" there but he fixes toilets, paints trees, repairs fences and furniture and electrical circuits everywhere, and all of this BESIDES already doing accounting work and seeing clients (there is also a mini-hotel there where people can come to sleep for the night), he also sometimes serves them), not to mention he never had a say in anything that actually meant managing the restaurant) and even my mom's low self esteem (she's been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and from her stories, she has had a low self esteem long before I was even born; she had childhood trauma of alcoholic parents and her dad having passed when she was 10, she also had two sisters which were/are 10 respectively 20 years older than her, so she hadn't seen much of her oldest sister, and the middle sister hated her and used to push her out the bed, not let hear eat, etc. (her mom was never aware since she was always drunk)), told me I'm only making my parents life harder and I should just stop whining and be normal. I've presented some trauma from their lives so you can understand that they are and have been going through a lot as well.

The problem is I cannot even go to school anymore. I am about to finish 11th grade in a technological school (summer break starts in July and ends in early September - which gives only about one month and a half of summer vacation), and while there's only around a month left from school I don't think I can pass it. Especially because of math and economy, we had semestrial papers (which are between an exam and a test, and they're worth 25% of your final grade) in math, and tomorrow there will be the economy one and I suck so bad at these two subjects (all my other classes are decently high marks), and my math paper was terrible and I'm sure economy will be the same, and I'll have to take the corrective exams to pass into 12th grade. But the corrective exams are material from the whole year, and I'm sure if I do get to the point I have to take them, I won't be able to pass them, and therefore will have to repeat 11th grade. If I have to repeat 11th grade it's all just over for me. Over. I'm already 19 and if I do need to repeat 11th grade I'll be 21 when I graduate (this only if I don't have to repeat 12th grade, or 11th again). I wanted to go to the psychology/philosophy/languages university but I have no achievements for my portfolio, and if I do get to even take the baccalaureate I'm sure my grade in math would drag my already mediocre results in native language and geography down enough for no university to accept me. Especially without a portfolio. But I don't even think I can pass 11th grade at this point. 

I've been considering dropping out. My parents tell me almost everyday to just drop out and give up on my life and future already, as I said, but if I do drop out I would live under the constant distress that well, I dropped out. I have been s**cidal ever since I was 12. Almost my whole body is covered in self harm and self-inflicted bruises. I am also severely overweight. The only option I would have is drop out, focus on my health and (hopefully, but unrealistically) heal my mental health and lose all the excess weight, and then finish my studies in a night school and take an exam equivalent to the baccalaureate. But that would still mean I won't be able to go to university. And if somehow I am able to, it would only be the area around customer services and marketing (which I learned so far in technological highschool, and which I hate; I wanted to pursue philosophy, languages or psychology as I said. Mostly psychology, since I wanted to maybe become for others the help I needed but never got... All my life all I ever wanted was to help people but I was always told my advice is sh*t, I'm cringy and I should just shut up...)

I feel whatever I do from now on, I'm certain it will lead to me taking my life, or at least attempting to, and if I don't make it I'll try again. I just see no way out of this, I see no future for myself, no good outcome if I'll still be alive. I just wish I could end everything right here and now, yesterday I was crying myself to sleep wondering if I'll have the opportunity to take pills soon (be left alone at home), and pondering how to go about my s**cide letter. But I just can't, I just can't because my mom told me of I died (especially taking my own life), my dad would k*ll himself too and leave her alone in the world (she told me she'd be too scared to try to end her life too, but assured me that dad would most likely be able to do it).

I don’t think he’ll pry and honestly I’m not going to offer anything unsolicited but I’m just asking for possible suggestions.

663,I had a mental breakdown.,"A few weeks ago I made a post stating I would kill myself if I lost my job. I then proceeded to get fired. I was planning on ending it, but instead I had a complete mental breakdown, spent almost a grand on camping supplies, left my family a note, then drove so far north that the highways ran out, and the nearest excuse for civilization was almost 300kms away. All with the vague idea of either surviving as a hermit, or dying in the woods with my cat.

I thought it was all pointless, and that I was never going to amount to anything, and that I was better off either dead or gone.

To be honest, I still sort of feel that way.

I was up there all alone, ready to start my life as a nomad, i had built myself a camp and never had any intention of seeing another human again, when some RCMP officers found me, they told me there were people looking for me, and took my back to where my parents where waiting, and i later found out that a ton of my friends and family had rallied together to find me, had just dropped everything and spread all over northern Saskatchewan, and somehow had managed it. i thought i had covered my tracks so well, i left my phone at home, and only ever used cash past that point, but there some miracle they still found me. 

I'm back at home with my parents now, and getting the help i need. I'm seeing a therapist and I'm on some new meds.

I guess the point of this post is just me trying to say that there are people that most likely care about you, and that getting help is important.

I am deleting my reddit account, this website is horrible and does nothing good for my or anyone else's mental state.

666,What got me to this point,"Since I was a kid I have memory, I’ve been through the worse things and I’ve been the worse. 
As a kid I was the nicest, everyone used to use me as “the reference kid” when anything bad happen. As “you should be like him”(meaning me) but something changed. 
My dad used to drink a lot, be ausent, mom used to work too many hours, they took me to a really poor country in South America to live there because they are from there. 
They split up, fought a lot, I was abused by my cousin, people at school used to bully me because I was the only immigrant they’ve ever seen. I’ve been beaten the shit out more than I’d like to admit. I used to be scare, nauseous to go to school in the morning just because I was gonna get fucked up or bullied. At this point I was only 12. 

After that, everything went downhill, we ended up coming back to my home country (just my mom, brother and I)
My first love at 16 cheated on my with my step dad wich at the time was my only male figure to follow since my dad never really cared or spoke to me again. And I think that’s when everything changed, I started doing really crazy things, abusing every kind of drug, having really bad behavior at school and having anger attacks where I’d scare my family. Things are been getting worse and worse with the time. 
I do not take anymore drugs, I do not have anymore anger attacks, but I’ve become somebody I hate, somebody I don’t know and it’s the opposite of what I’ve always been. 

Im 22, no friends, only a girlfriend and I’m hurting her because how toxic I’ve become and I just can’t change it, I want to leave her but I can’t, I really depend on her, it’s all I have in this world. It’d be more easy to kill myself, but honestly, my mom doesn’t deserve the pain I’ve been through, she has always been the best person. I’m trapped in life, and honestly some people are too broken to be fixed up. It’s been a year since I attempted suicide and I still don’t like how life and people work. I don’t like living, it’s starting to feel like a really difficult thing to be conscient instead of sleeping.

i feel like i need support from someone who can be in my life actively. i have some friends but i cannot rely on them too much, everyone is going through their own things. i miss the help and support from my mom, which i can only get virtually now. better than nothing, but it has gotten to be too much. the health issues are making everything worse. i feel very scared and hopeless, out of control over my life, i have to skip classes sometimes, i don’t do my work well enough. i dont know what to do. and i also need to move in just 2 months and i cannot find a place, which is something that definetely took a toll on me and continues to do so. there is only so much i can do at once, and i feel like i am failing. i’m asking for help, but the help i get is very minimal and insuficient. no one wants to help me and see how much im struggling on my own. any advice?

Every time I started working a new job, my mental health takes a RAPID, crazy, **deep** descent. Like really bad. I’m okay for like a week or two then it all goes to shit. 


My ADHD is bad but my social anxiety makes work much, much worse. It’s not a matter of me being “lazy”, if I didn’t have social anxiety working would be MUCH better. 


Im definitley scared about what’s to come again. It’s kind of like “well at least I had some
time to be happy at home! Time to be fucked up again!” Since being at home i felt like I gained a part of me I’ve lost before, the part of me that died with working retail. 


last year I literally was self harming, doing bad reckless stuff because my depression got SO BAD. At every job I’ve had people either try to take advantage of me - even had 1 job where this guy was trying to physically intimidate me


I saw a tiktok and this girl was talking about how she felt “deficient” in the sense that she can’t function in society and I literally feel like that lmao as pathetic as it sounds. 


I’m waiting until I can get my license, buy a car and do delivery… I want to do that so bad. Until then I’m stuck going “hI hOw aRE yOu 😃😃😃😃” every 2 minutes at whatever jobs I have to work in the interim.

I've started drinking more then usual to compensate for the lack of chemicals in my brain. Now when I wake up I feel super depressed from the anxiousness I feel until I get to enjoy some drinks after a long day. I've been taking a break but it's the one thing that makes me a social creature and I can't see myself going the completely sober spiritual journey like I've tried before. I enjoy other things that take away the normalcy and complacency of life but it only lasts for a couple days until it seems to be worse then before. I can't come to terms with wanting to speak to a therapist because there's trauma in my life that I'd rather just keep repressing instead of bringing to the surface and dealing with.

I'm so mad right now i don't even give a damn about grammar so please deal with it. after we did the preentry thing with the turn signals and the brakes or whatever the instructor told me to overtake the car in front of me (i guess there were problems with their car so they couldn't move on to the test?) and pull into lot 1. simple enough right? not for a dumbass like me. i overtook them and tried to pull in to do the test when she immediately stopped me and said i failed and my test was over. what the fuck did i even do i asked myself. she called my dad over and said i ran the stop sign which was right in front of the car i overtook. i didn't even see it because of them. and here i go again with the excuses or the ""it wasn't my fault.."" cant even take fucking accountability.

why does shit like this always happen to me? always always always always. i cant catch a fucking break. it took me almost a year to get my permit because my mom never felt like taking me, then they told me to go home twice because of some stupid discrepancies. i feel so behind my friends and classmates......everyone's driving and doing their own thing and look at me. always lagging behind. I'm still shackled. why does it come so easy to everyone but me? useless useless piece of shit. i know i let my dad down, took out time out of his busy work day to accompany me and look what i did. i had a feeling i would make some stupid mistake like that...its in my nature.

all in the spam of 2 weeks: prom night, practically ruined over some stupid shit, which held back 10 other people for 2 fucking hours at the venue. they jokingly blamed me as if i hadn't already blamed myself, and i cried on the way there. graduation, no one even heard my name/cheered for me because MY fucking teacher butchered my name SO BADLY. WHEN CAN I CATCH A BREAK???? i don't know why anyone is friends with me to be honest, I'm too much of a hassle to deal with...I'm not deserving of anything they say i am. already getting my license late and now i have to wait until the end of the month? just let me fade away, please. please lord just grant me that. any time i try and lift myself up, or fix my issues, it just never works. i try and try and try and try and try and keep going and i keep. hitting. roadblocks. i don't want to try anymore. I'm tired of trying. I'm tired...so tired.

this might seem like something small but its just the final push off the cliff of what i think is depression. and you know what I'm most scared of? that I'm not even depressed and this is just my laziness and unwillingness to make a difference in my own life. i think its that, i have no reason to be depressed but what else can explain this feeling. I'm not even going to enjoy these next couple weeks like i planned...ill probably fail that test too. turning my phone off for the day, I'm not talking with anyone. bold that I'm assuming i can even get a text back from the person i want to talk with most. stupid of me to assume he might have the slightest feeling for me.

i wish i could just float endlessly in a void of nothingness for today, maybe longer. all you do is let yourself down. it never ends--it never will. useless useless useless useless useless useless useless useless useless useless useless useless useless useless useless useless useless useless useless useless useless useless useless useless useless useless useless useless useless useless useless useless useless useless useless useless useless useless useless useless useless useless useless

But when we were in high school, others used to tell me she is jealous of me. She would say stuff like how I got 'A' grades just because I'm pretty and sweet. She also casually bodyshames me about how her boobs look way better than mine. However I ignored all that just I because I knew her since childhood and also our parents are friends. Something bad (which I don't want to talk about) happened to me when I was 16-17 and she casually took fun of it all at that time too. Yesterday I met her again and I am feeling the worst I've had ever. She casually passed racist and misogynistic comments about other people we used to know. She bodyshamed me again and this time it's really getting to me. Nobody has ever made me feel this insecure about my body. I cried the entire night and couldn't sleep. I also feel the depression associated with my 16/17 yr self coming back. Is there any way to get rid of it without help?",1654625367.0,2,1.0,2,0,v739l7,t3
688,Need advice,Sorry if I rant a little bit but I don’t understand how I should feel anymore and I need some outside advice on my situation. I’ll go a little deep into my personal life so y’all can sympathize a little bit with me.

As I get older I understand all she sacrificed for me and my siblings. My dad got two women pregnant at once so I had a brother 6 months older than me that I was basically twins with we did everything and at 16 he died from a drug overdose. Which surprised me because we were inseparable and even though I know he smoked and drank I’ve never seen him pop a pill which really surprised me and my family. After that it really affected my dad and a month ago due to lots of reasons my dad committed suicide. I also don’t blame him for it because I know why and understand why he killer himself but for me I’m my life I’ve grown up so strong and dependent on myself that I do everything by myself and for myself.  To the point I got a full ride scholarship to college I make good money I have great things on track for me in my life but I’m lost and idk how to feel anymore.

“hey bro, ive just been doing alot of thinking about yesterday and all that happened. i understand i messed up and fucked the stick up but just the freakout was a little overboard in my opinion. i like hangin with you it just feels like you use me as a scapegoat when your upset and just put it all out on me and its genuinely taking a toll on my mental health whether i wanna admit it or not. ive just noticed that you get upset with sum I do at least once every time we hangout, you even said yourself you get upset over dumb reasons, but from what ive seen you dont do that with anyone else. i wanna be your friend but if this keeps happening i cant be your friend because i need to put my mental health and happiness over what i want.”

bob then said just straight up “u r annoying” and followed up with “And for some reason my friends decided ur our friend so when I’m bored we hangout no I’m not using u as a scapegoat? That’s weird to say idk ur overthinking it. I wouldn’t ever have hyu never if my friends didn’t feel bad for u enuff with all ur sob stories to be ur friend”

718,I think I somehow manifested my depression,"I was never sad at first. This took place mid 2020, while we recently just started online classes and we were on full lockdown. School was kinda hard, they gave us an unreasonable amount of homework that honestly stunned me and my sisters. It took me and my other 2 sisters 3 days of constantly working on my math homework for us to finish it. It was only for ONE week and both my sisters are in college. 

Anyways...I never felt the usual signs of depression when I first started cutting. I wasn't really sad, but I wasn't really happy either. About 4 months in, I started to realize that I was doing it for attention. I would catch myself slicing my wrists the night before I would go to the mall, or anytime I go outside. I never went too deep, only enough that you would see it.

I never liked it when the marks faded. I liked looking at the scars, it reminded me of my ""depression"" and how I used that as an excuse to procrastinate on homework and chores. But the thing is, I never told anyone. No one in my family knew that I cut. I was using that excuse on myself. Nothing was wrong with me, and that was the problem. Nothing traumatic happened. I was never raped or abused, I was treated kindly. So I never knew why I suddenly felt so unhappy

I couldn't find an explanation on why my grades suddenly dropped. On why I couldn't submit homework. On how I went from a straight A student, to someone who can barely start homework. I WANTED something wrong with me. I wanted an explanation

2021, I suddenly stopped bathing and brushing my teeth. Getting out of bed felt like a chore itself. I told myself that I would do work tomorrow, then tomorrow came but it was a shitty day so I told myself that I'd do it ""tomorrow"" and the cycle never stopped. Suddenly I started cutting every night, rather than the usual before an outing. After I cut myself I would douse it in alcohol and rub it in, after a few seconds it would fade, then I'd put more alcohol on it again. I'd keep my nails long because scratching fresh cuts and looking at the blood underneath my nails felt nice.

 I had the classic signs of depression. But I told myself I should be happy because now something is wrong. But I'll never forget how I felt during those days. There was a constant lingering sense of regret, fear, and my chest was always heavy. I was constantly scared that my mother would find out I was slowly failing school. And I regret never doing homework or even trying too

i have made peace with that decision for a pretty long time and i just have nothing to lose anymore. we will all rot in a grave anyway no matter what our destinies are it WILL end the same way. by becoming a corpse.

722,I've made money to ease my pain that it caused other issues,"personally, for me, I think money can buy me happiness. but after getting money I'm missing the things that can make me happy. 

I'm young (early 20s) and I made a lot of money in stocks during the pandemic. I always thought when I get money ill make the people around me more comfortable. this made me happy for a while, seeing those I love have a little more freedom financially; my parents don't worry about bills or mortgage payments as much, and a few friends and family having kids, getting married, and starting to buy houses so an easy gift was money.

this brings me joy when they realize they can have more freedom or spend a little to get what they actually wanted out of their situations. but I came to the realization that my happiness was temporary. it's not like I want anything in return from them, after all, it was my choice to gift them the money. but it was the realization that it hadn't been my turn. I would say I've never had or had anything lead to a serious relationship but i wondered when would it be my turn. it wasn't my turn to build a home, it wasn't my turn to get married, and it wasn't my turn to build a family. 

I know that self-love is important and I've worked on that for quite some time after being in a poor state. but there comes a time when you're lonely and want someone in your life. I and my best friend grew distant so I don't have a person I can talk to about everything and anything.

Therapy is not the fucking answer. Maybe it works for some people, but for people like me who are just too far gone, therapy doesn't do shit. I've been to 4 different therapists over the past 7 years! I feel absolutely no different. My therapists were never able to understand or grasp what I was feeling, they never offered any meaningful help or advice, they never got to the bottom if my issues or found the root cause of anything...but even if they did, what would that do? It wouldn't change anything. The most helpful advice they gave me was ""go outside and take walks"". That was basically all I got from it. 

I've been working with my current therapist for well over a year now. Nothing has changed, very little progress has been made. And now that my health insurance has expired, I can't even afford to go anymore.

725,am i faking it?,"so i’ve never been to a doctor or a therapist to diagnose me (for other things yes but not to get a diagnosis) for any mental illness. but i have accepted i have been living with severe depression for so long, the earliest realization (when i realized it was becoming more prominent) i can think of to date would be around 4th or 5th grade. for reference im going to be a senior in high school in a couple of months. lately more than ever i’ve been having some troubling thoughts. i’ll give you an example. i don’t shower consistently. since i started my job (im also a SUPER self conscious person my self esteem is non existent so im embarrassed about everything i do &amp; everything about me) i started showering almost everytime before work (i work 4 days a week) but shower around 3-5. i feel like im faking what i think i have. because sometimes i’ll go into really dark depressive episodes where i won’t move from my bed for days. and that got SUPER bad during 2020 and most of 2021 bc of covid. but i do things in my daily life like go to school, talk to people, go out and do things i need to, but i am so mentally exhausted i feel like i have nothing to be exhausted from. because when i don’t have work or school i literally am at home doing nothing or smoking weed or watching tv or cleaning my room (what i can manage). i would say im what you call someone with high functioning depression , that’s if i have it. about the shower thing too , i feel like i don’t take care of myself physically like i do mentally. i’ll start smelling my armpits out of fear and i sweat a ton all over my body so i sweat my deodorant off fast. sometimes when i get to work my armpits smell a bit. i never carry deodorant with me and i should. i feel like i get dirty fast mostly bc i sweat. even when i don’t i still feel dirty.

743,Rather not try at all than to try and fail.,"The current state of this country makes it 100% impossible for the average young adult to move out on their own. I only have around $2,500 in my bank account at 19 (I know, depressing, right), all because my decent paying job (that I was so sure would be the gateway), keeps screwing me over again and again with the shortest shifts of all time, and not even scheduling me for more than once or twice a week. 

Normally, I would just quit and find somewhere better to work, but most other jobs in my area pay less than my current one and I can't risk the same ""barely scheduling"" bs happening over there, 'cause that would mean I just screwed myself over. I have no car to do any of those easy ride-sharing jobs (like Uber or Lyft, all those lucky mfs gotta do is drive). I would apply for a job in the big leagues, like a bank, but they would never accept me 'cause literally all I have is retail experience.

And the worst part is this country is making it more and more impossible for a person like me to finally move out on their own. I know I could've applied for college and lived in a dorm, but my grades weren't good enough in high school. They would've rejected me, and I would infinitely rather not try at all than to try and fail. Plus, my current job would've never carried all those intense college fees I would've had. 

This is getting long, so I'll wrap it up. I'm tired of having unrealistic plans (like moving out at a young age) that I hope for but probably will never happen. Recently, I started contemplating just emptying all my $2,500 from the bank and blowing it all on something stupid. 'Cause it's not like that money can buy or rent a house, $2,500 in real estate is like walking into a convenience store with two pennies. Then, after emptying the money, I'll continue to work my penny-paying job to live in a suitcase from hotel to motel.

Whenever I am awake, I think about how I could end it. But on the other side, I like to live life to the fullest and do as much fun stuff as I can, I like to travel I like to go to parties I like to have fun and do extreme things like skydiving or riding motorcycles. 

A part of me wants to die and a part of me wants to live and these conflicting thoughts have been hard on me, I want to know if there are people dealing with this that have any tips or tricks on how to cope. 

I am glad to say that I have not made a direct attempt at taking my own life but the only thing I fear is me in the worst moments because I don't know what I will do, I have been in one of these moments before, once while working and it got so bad that I pushed a cigarette out on my skin just to feel something else. This happened in January and I have fallen out of work because of the mental issues pain and traumas that I have endured in parts of my life, all combined with work stress and exhaustion from working 50 hours a week.

I do work still but only one day in the week and only for 6 to 7 hours and that is already hard for me now. The work does not give me as much stress as the company I work for, they keep asking when I will be able to work full time again but I am still recovering and going to therapy.

The only coping that I do is just pushing these thoughts away but They will always come back worse, especially when I am in bed and not being able to do anything just because I fear myself. 

Just to clarify I am not scared of death the only thing in life that I fear is me at my worst.

There are also 2 reasons why I am not able to kill myself, one is that I cannot do this to my family I can't put them through this and the second reason is that I feel like there is a reason that I got put on the earth and that I need to do that first before I can go peacefully.

(Two days, two nights, two off) So, when I'm home, I don't have a lot of time before I have to sleep and do it all over again. When I do have days off, I have zero drive to do anything. Even the things I used to enjoy. I've been in a deep depression for over a year now. Unable to find lasting joy in early anything. When I've tried therapy, I just felt worse after each session. I couldn't stay on the meds I was prescribed. (I've never been good at staying on any medication for more than a week or so.) The one solace I had, was knowing that my wife was there. She had my back, even when I didn't feel like my back was worth having. And even though I didn't really show appreciation, I felt it. Just a little bit. But, with the mental health issues she's been fighting for a couple years now, DID &amp; PTSD mostly, she's unable to do it anymore. After almost 20 years, she asked for a divorce. She says I gave up on myself. Maybe I did. I just felt like nothing could fix me. So, I took the approach I'd always taken. Lie. Lie to myself. Lie to everyone around me. Just fake it and make everyone think I was okay when, I haven't been okay for a very long time. Probably longer than even I realize. So, now I feel the worst I've ever felt.

757,Nightmare at the mechanic and feeling depressed afterwards. I feel so helpless.,"I’m 26 years old and have had a bad stutter all my life, I’m pretty much a covert stutterer so I try to hide it best I can. Going to restraunts, doctor appointments and many other places have always been a nightmare for me, I get super nervous to speak my name and order food.  

I still live with my patents and lately I’ve been dealing with depression, I feel like there’s no hope for my future.  

So yesterday I take my car to the mechanic to get new brakes, I never trusted mechanics, I always feel like they screw me over. The guy gets in my car, takes it for a spin then drives it back to the front. There is white smoke coming from the exhaust and he asks me if I’ve ever seen that before. I said I’ve never seen that white smoke before in my life. He accuses me of lying and I quickly go into panic mode, I had no idea how to defend myself or get any words out. I felt completely helpless and embarrassed in front of other people in the lobby.  

This just made my fears of public places much worse. As soon as I got home I broke down crying. Also it’s been two years since I needed a new car inspection and I’ve still never done that because I’m terrified of saying my name.  

I’m just so sad guys, I try so hard to put myself out there and take control but sometimes it just comes back and hurts me.

I have a family and they don't want to know anything about me. The last time I talked to my mother about this, she told me that I earned enough for going to psychologist to medicate me and that she no longer wanted to know anything about it.

My father has suffered from depression, and even years ago he attempted suicide. One day I tried to talk to him about how he felt, and he didn't want to listen to me either. He told me to go to a psychologist because talking to me reminded him of his worst state and he didn't want to be like that again ""for listening to my problems""

The psychologist I went to, after 5 sessions in which she couldn't remember my name, ended up saying that she wanted me to compare me to people who ""really have a hard time"", like homeless people or people from Ukraine, and that if even so, it does not help me, it's because I'm selfish.

I don't even drink anymore, I don't smoke, I don't do drugs. I try to keep my relationships harmonious. But somehow my life is still a fuck up, I only have like a 5-10 minute drive to work and i've already had 2 driving incidents this year (1 - a dog ran into the car while going 60km/h with no time to react, 2 - I tapped into a pedestrian with the wing mirror while overtaking a bus as the pedestrian started to veer into the road and bus started moving off and tried to squeeze past) Anyways I'm trying to make peace with the fact that at this point I'll probably be in jail one day - like how dumb do you have to be to get into all these incidents that nobody usually ever has to deal with - I'm literally the dumbest driver I don't even know how I got my licence and the funny thing is I have passed 2 different countries driving tests.

I worked out pretty consistently for 5-6 months and was seeing good progress and putting on muscle and weight. I was eating healthier. I was getting taking care of myself better. I was getting outside and trying to do things. It just never matters. I am always depressed. I don’t care about myself enough to do things just for me. I just don’t have a big ego or anything. I just want to have some friends or a relationship. It’s so hard going day in and day out with nobody who cares about you and doing everything on your own. I’ve never had many friends and I actually used to enjoy being alone and doing my own thing because I’ve had to my whole life as an only child.

Not to be my therapist necessarily. I’ll never tell anybody my deepest thoughts in person. It’d just be nice to have somebody to encourage and support me with no judgement. Someone to just say it’ll be okay. I don’t know what makes me so undesirable. I know I’m unattractive and tend to be more introverted, but I try to be more loose and outgoing around new people.

I don’t want to say I’m more mature, but I find it weird how I can connect and talk to people older than me just fine but making friends with people my age just seems so hard.

but anyway you get it, time is wacky, my brain is fucked. 
i've been depressed just about my whole life, untreated for half of it and had random pills shoved down my throat for three years before they found the right ones, bada bing bada boom.
anyway now i'm here, i'm not constantly trying to kms or thinking about it all the time. the last couple of months have been shitty but with residual trauma that's expected. it was last week when shit really hit the fan.
monday night- this bitch triggers the fuck out of me and i go batshit, my boyfriend compares me to his abusive ex and everyone in that house agrees i flipped out because of my age and not because the 30 year old cunt called me a liar about my mental illness.
my boyfriend wasn't  talking to me because now he's overwhelmed while having to live in her house and then on thursday i had to put my dog down.
the dog that stopped me from hurting myself and fucking my life over more than i already have.
and he still doesn't call me back.
at that point the only line of local support i have is gone. all i can do is hope other people text me back and i still don't know what's going on with him.
anyway- now today, i talk to him in the morning he says he'll call and he doesn't. i go on facebook and he blocked me. i go on my other one and see that he's apparently single.
I call him and finally he talks to me, he says there's a lot we need to talk about like i haven't been trying to talk to him all week and the only reassurance i get is that he's still my friend. we're supposed to talk tomorrow so let's see if he actually calls.
How does someone who have loved and known you for two years ignore you when you need them most. After all the talks about my shit how do you still not understand how quickly I can spiral when I'm hurt. 
I'm tired of hurting, I want to be okay and I want to trust someone without having it broken. I'm just sick of being broken. But the worst part is, I don't want to lose him. I don't want to to find someone new I just want the man I love.

The ECT helps for a few days then I go back to being tired and bored and apathetic. Not really sure what to try next.

&amp;#x200B;

 I've been on most SSRIs, some SNRIs, atypicals, SamE, and Vitamin D supplements. I've also done TMS, EMDR, years of therapy (CBT, DBT, ACT, and Trauma Informed) and two inpatient stays. My psychiatrist mentioned wanting to do Emsam patches but he's been reluctant to switch me because I'd need to be off my current meds for two weeks and he's worried abt liability. I don't really think the current meds are helping anyway so hopefully I am able to make the switch soon. From all my research it looks like Emsam and Parnate are kinda the last two real options for me at this point. Anyone have experience with these for TRD?

&amp;#x200B;

In terms of more out there stuff I've done shrooms (thought not in a clinical setting) and I can't afford Ketamine.

788,Advice needed to encourage and support my s/o,"My partner (39m) is really depressed. He speaks so negatively about himself and the world (not super surprising considering the state of it all). To say I am concerned and worried about him is an understatement. 

I (37f) am by no means a super upbeat or constantly positive person, but I'm pretty solutions orientated and try to look on the bright side when I have capacity to do so. 
I have been dealing with OCD and Panic Disorders since my early teens. Dealing with = finding help through therapy, meditation and coping strategies. 

My father was a psychologist and suffered greatly from clinical depression up until the day he took his own life. I was 13. So this is actually quite a triggering situation for me to be in. 

At this stage, I'm finding it really difficult (near impossible) to know what to say to him or how to help him. It's like anything I say gets taken as an attack. He gets really sensitive and defensive. 

His upbringing and background has meant that he hasn't been supported much or been given much guidance by way of mental health. (Irish Catholic) Instead, he internalises all of his stress and becomes avoidant/dismissive/withdrawn. 

I really love him and don't want to move on or give up.
Instead, I'm looking for helpful ways to approach supporting him without just constantly giving him space or letting him 'figure it out' by bottling up.

Part of me feels like he needs to figure it out and decide on his own. But we're not getting any younger and I really just want to see him enjoying the positive aspects of his life. I genuinely care about him.

It's almost like I need a script. This would be so useful. Or a type of step-by-step game plan.

but if i do she will go in a frenzy since she has mental issues and will most likely hurt herself, she has self harmed recently and just today tried to down a bottle of pills but i stopped her she keeps making me promise to make sure i'd look after her mother and dog when she does it, has tried to call out to legal suicide places in switzerland and canada to help with assisted suicide.

just to mention she has adhd and finds it hard to concentrate and possible BPD if she does its quite extreme, has alot of mood swings. she has never gotten much her whole life emotionally and has alot of trauma.

i've tried talking to people when she attempted before i called the guards (irish police) they were help then they said next time call an ambulance instead which is plan on doing as well as telling CAHMS and her GP before i break the news. me and her breaking up wouldn't be a reason for suicide.

her parents doesn't help she is polish and they are very strict emotionally and doesn't really understand or believe her. i'm sick of her life being put on my hands. it's stressful and i just want to not worry about her anymore because i'm feeling worse because of it and then if something happens to her i wouldn't be able to live with myself plus i love and care for her and her health.

I have my final state exams soon i just cant focus.

shes abusive mentally and sometimes physically

brings the worst out of me, destroys me mentally

i want her to get help and to not be my ""problem"" but i do love her its just stressful worrying about her mental health all the time. as i speak she hung up after she was cutting up a razor blade to self harm. she doesn't use suicide as a excuse if i leave she just tells me she wants to and makes subtle hints about how she wants to or will soon and when she has melt downs she leaves the house so i put a tracker on her phone to make sure i know where she is but i don't want to do this anymore.

I live in Ireland, Shes 17, Im 18 \*M\*

She is going therapy and camhs \*child mental health services\* here in ireland all of which are not helping her.

talking to her parents wont help either as her dad isn't there and her mum disregards her issues because of her up bringing.

help me i need a way to be able to make sure she will be okay and not have to hurt myself in this process.

im afriad ill turn out like she is.

if i call an ambulance she wont be able to sit her exams and if she gets out and didnt do her exams which is huge for her she will definitely do something.

help me please. i need someone's advice, i had a gps on her but she blocked me at some point and it turned off and now i never know where she is this is horrible.

i dont want to be with her. i don't enjoy her presence she is mentally draining and tells me horrible things everyday and i dont have time for friends. but she depends on me for everything mentally.

i want to be able to block her and never speak again. i cant bring myself to do it never knowing if i was a turning point or her last break.

795,My parents don't give a shit about me,"My parents don't give a shit about me. I realized this when I first realized I was truly depressed. I know when you're depressed you tend to over think the relationship between you and everyone around you to the worst possible answer, but I promise you this is not that. Before I fully knew I was depressed I was doing amazing in high school with my AP classes and high honor roll. But then depression hit me and hit hard, I went down to nearly failing, and it would've been completely failing if some teachers didn't take pity on me. This sudden change in grades didn't even spark a conversation. 

Later, my younger sister told me my aunt said I was probably depressed which means she probably also told my parents, and still not even a conversation. It's so obvious I am depressed they shouldn't even need my aunt telling them. I was failing school, my free time just became sleeping and using my phone as a constant distraction, and if you listen closely you can hear me crying every other day, and still they didn't mention it. 

I had started posting super depressing thoughts on a private snapchat story and one of my friends reached out to my brother who then sent a text to my mom telling me to do something about me because I was literally suicidal. And still they did not talk to me.

It was only when I posted part of a suicide note to that same private snapchat story my friends panicked and messages my parents and some counselor? I'm not sure but I heard my mom on the phone with them. Then she had a ~5 minute conversation with me saying that she cares and whatnot, not even touching upon the suicide note part.

It's been about a year and a half since then and almost nothing has changed. They never ask how I'm doing and as far as I know they never even think about it. The only thing they have mentioned since then was when my brother died in an accident, my mom mentioned they couldn't bare losing another child, which I think might have been a reference to me being suicidal but I'm not entirely sure. 

I've never been really close with my parents, and I suppose I never really told them about my day because they never asked. I get that they're neglectful but ignoring serious signs of depression and suicidal thoughts too? It's not that they don't believe depression exists, because they've said that they do. It's not that they're too busy because they have all the time in the world. And it's not that I just haven't noticed any signs because my life is so uneventful I would remember even the slightest thing. They both were so devastated at my brother's funeral so it's not like they won't miss me if I kill myself, but it also still feels like they just genuinely don't care at all. It's almost like they don't care for me but still will get sad if I commit suicide only because they cannot handle death. My parents don't give a shit about me.",1654518804.0,0,1.0,1,0,v62hin,t3

This year, I don't even know what I'm doing. I feel so lost all the time. I'm so close on giving up. I had to stop thinking ending it all because I don't want to leave people around me traumatized.",1654603179.0,0,1.0,3,0,v6tk9e,t3
797,I'm nothing without my depression.,"I feel as if I am no one without my depression.

I first started getting depressed at 13. It all started with anxiety from my first job, which I thought I was old enough for. I wish I could go back in time and stop myself for years worth of pain just because I wanted a stupid job.
After I quit my job, I thought it would all be over. No more anxiety, nothing. But it stayed with me.
It grew quickly into depression. My room would always be filled with rotting food and moldy drinks on the floor, unwashed clothes scattered around, which I'd still wear despite them being dirty. 
I'd cry every night over how I wanted to just not exist. 
For a year I hid it, until I told my mum. She was supportive, but nothing helped.
We couldn't get into any therapists, and without that, I couldn't get any medication.
So for years it just stayed with me. And since I grew up in my teen years with it, my personality changed completely. It feels as if I only developed a proper personality because of depression.

All I've ever known is depression. So to take that away, who would I be?
I got used to the depression after 2 years. It felt normal to have, it felt safe for me. I forgot what it was like to be ""normal"" 
I basically grew my whole proper personality with depression. So to live without it is like losing a bestfriend who influenced everything about you.

Around this time, I also started growing new symptoms of something. I had constant anger, hitting my head into things, lots of impulsive things I'd do to my body, like dyeing my hair into the most ugliest mess I'd seen, causing me to hate myself. I'd get into fights with people, and I had constant disassociation at least 5 times a day. I wasn't myself. So a few months before I turned 16, I had decided to take fluoxetine (antidepressants)
This was something so different.

The moment I took that first tablet, I had motivation.
I would clean my room everyday, wake up at 6am, make my bed, and I'd be more active. But it was like I was on auto pilot.
I never cried and it was hard to. I didn't realise I was alive, and I just forgot I was ""me"".
These tablets also caused physical damage to my body.
I couldn't eat. The tablets made me want to throw up by the smell of food, and even when I would eat, I'd get diarrhoea. So it never processed right. I lost weight fast. I was already considered skinny, but now I had a thigh gap. I didn't completely hate it.
After 4 months, I abruptly stopped the tablets. 

I didn't want to depend on tablets for the rest of my life. For awhile, I was ok. But now, a few months later, it's all coming back.

My room is always messy, drinks and bags of rubbish everywhere. I even dropped out of school to join a stupid university which now I realise I don't like the subject I'm studying. My anxiety is back, and I took 3 weeks off work to apply for different jobs, since I'll be withdrawing from my course, which my job depends on.

I just hate it all. Why am I like this? Constant anxiety and depression. I don't know how I can live with it. Anytime I cry, my mum gets angry. Calling me dramatic.
I feel like I've ruined my future. Doing impulsive stuff, and now I hate what I've done. I now have even worse depression and anxiety, but I'm scared to tell my mum. She used to be supportive, but she's drained now. I don't blame her.

Since 13 I had been nagging for a therapist. She doesn't want to bear anymore of it, and I don't want to tell my friends since it'll look like some attention seeking stuff. I'm scared and I'm trying to hide it. I don't want to live anymore. This is all too much and it's my fault.

I shouldn't have stopped my tablets, even if it felt like I wasn't in control. Like it was someone else controlling me.
I shouldn't have unenrolled from school to do a course that I wasn't 100% sure of.
My mum doesn't believe I have anxiety or depression anymore either. Anytime I try talking about it, she says I ""made an adult decision and have to face the adult consequences."" 

I know I did. But I'm trying to get help. 

Somehow, I am everything and nothing with depression.

798,I have an unhealthy obsession with the idea of being mentally disabled so I wouldn’t be able to think so deeply about things,I don’t want to kill myself because I’m afraid of death and what the people around me will think and feel. I have existential anxiety and I stress all the time about mortality and the universe and what happens when we die or when the universe ends or whatever. I’m not trying to act like I’m a genius or something but I feel like if I was just not as smart or something then maybe it wouldn’t be so hard. I struggle with talking to people and relationships and I honestly don’t think I’ll be able to work a normal job. I have an unofficial diagnosis of autism and it feels like people overestimate what I can do since i would be considered “high functioning.” They see that I am able to talk and comprehend things and I seem “normal” so I must be able to do everything that they can do but I can’t. This way of life is just too much for me and sometimes I wish I could just hit my head really hard or something so that everything was simpler. I would still be able to be around my friends and family and do the things I enjoy like drawing but I wouldn’t have the capacity to think about these really heavy things. They say ignorance is bliss and I just really miss when I was a kid and it was simpler because I didn’t understand these things. I knew they existed but I couldn’t comprehend the impact of it.

806,I don’t like the apathy but I’m very afraid of NOT being apathetic,"So I after a long time of trying to see a psychiatrist, I finally forced myself to see one a few months ago. It wasn’t what I thought it was going to be and it really didn’t take long for them to put me on sertraline (not that that’s particularly bad). After a few months the medicine began to truly take effect as in if I went a couple of days without it, I would feel withdrawals pretty quickly and there was a noticeable change in my mood. I’ve noticed that I don’t feel much anymore.

It’s like being hollow. When nothing situational is triggering anything, I don’t feel anything. I don’t feel any positive or negative emotion; when I’m alone with no one to interact with or nothing to look forward to, I am just an empty shell. The apathy definitely has its benefits: I’m more confident because I don’t give a shit anymore, my anxiety is way down, hopelessness (while it’s still there) it’s wayyyyyy down. I suppose I’m struggling in the sense that I think I’m not TRULY enjoying anything. I’ll go out with friends and have an amazing time, but then get home and nothing matters again. I can’t immediately recall what I did in the past because I was basically in autopilot even though at the moment I never felt disconnect or out of control of myself. Depressive episodes, while not super often, are awful because it distresses me to want to feel something but I just can’t, so I’m stuck in a loop even though I know that in a couple of days I will be “fine” and back into autopilot.

I don’t feel like me anymore, but the me I was before always felt nothing was anything. I struggled to get out of bed, I procrastinated and lied about my responsibilities, my relationship with food was horrible and I would eat my feelings, and when stress made things really bad, I would spiral down into this loop of worthlessness and hopelessness because nothing felt real. 

I don’t feel human anymore, even if can’t really grasp what it actually is to be human. I’m convincing myself that it’s okay and the pros outweigh the cons. That my episodes are shorter and that I’m more productive. My milligrams are adjusted to what works without being overwhelming. I’m not TRULY apathetic and that now I can ACTUALLY care for the things I care about, even if it means forgetting those things once in a while.

But over the past few years it has got progressively worse to the point I barely function. I don't see anyone but my family that I live with and I had to leave my job as I couldn't handle it. I am not working atm and relying on my savings which are slowly running out as I have to pay for private therapy (I have a therapist and dietitian) and other obvious expenses as well as things related to my Body Dysmorphia which I just feel bad about. 

The thought of getting a new job terrifies me as I feel so disgusted by my body and am struggling so much with my ED that I can't face it.

I also have no clue what I want to do as a career or even what my interests are as I've spent the past 10 years wrapped up in my mental health struggles so it's so scary.

I spend my days procrastinating at the moment.. I am working on my ED but its very hard and at the moment I'm definitely back to almost square one - bingeing, restricting etc. 

Inside I am so scared of making any change or doing anything at all really as I just feel anxious, stressed. I consider a change but my mind thinks of 10 reasons why its a bad idea or what could go wrong and shuts me down before I can get started.


I have no one at home to talk to about this, only during therapy can I get this out but thats only like 50 mins per week..

First I want to say that I am french so my words might seem weird and my keyboard will type shit.

I am at the end of the rope. I don't know where to begin with. 
Two years ago the love of my life and I, we split, got divorced (i'm 30), and went our ways. We have a little boy together and so stayed in touch frequently. But we also had moments together (movies, diner and yes sex). I never believed I would lose her. She has never met anyone after me. But now she does. She's seeing someone, she wants to see other people, I can understand that. But I dont want to lose her. She's the love of my life. She said she'll eventually come back because we are suppose to be. And I believe it, I do want to believe.
Recently we had some moments. I believed we had something.
But when I found out she was seeing someone, my heart just broke. I couldn't take it. Thursday I sat on my bathroom and took every pills I could find in my place. Didn't work. Saturday to sunday night I filled up my bathtub, went in and started to cut my wrist. I wanted to end it all. The pain and the suffering I've felt for most of my life. And she was the only thing keeping me safe. Keeping me alive. Loosing her is just to much.
But i'll stay. Because she said she'll be back. And she can't come back if i'm not here. I love her, always will. I have to stay strong. I have to be better to be worthy.

I'm still angry about how I was mistreated at various points throughout my life by different people, hell, I'm still annoyed at various schoolchildren I went to school with who are now all grown up.

There are good things too, but I end up obsessing over happy memories, then I just get sad because those happy memories will never happen again,

My holidays in guernsey when I was 6, sitting on my grandma's lap and fondling her necklace at the age of 2, the day I took my favorite cuddly toys to school, when I lost my cuddly toy on the bus, hiding in the lockers after going swimming, the birthday parties I imagined having (which didn't happen), going down the yellow slide in victoria park then getting electrocuted by the static,  having friends who cared, playing with the ashes in the hearth, the breton jug my grandma had milk in, the priest in our village who moved away, Ms roland my reception teacher, playing make-believe that we were driving a car, the village fetes, the day the playground opened with its flower shaped speaking-pipes, the red nose days with their funny designs and crazy hair, the way that the teachers and childminders dressed on that day, the tv Shows I used to love, the garden I played in, how often lonely I felt, the coronation chicken I at at the terrace cafe St peter port in 2005 and 2006 (to this day the best tasting thing I ever ate), the sound of the catamaran ferry whilst it was at sea, walking across the stepping stones of a slow stream, climbing a red net and pretending to be spiderman, jumping in puddles in my fathers sawmill, taking off my gloves attached together with elastic and not understanding the concept of them being attatched, the way my school looked after it was vandalised

That all sort of came out at once, and its not all in the right chronological order, but I can't handle it so I keep to myself so I can process the fact that I exist.

871,"Unemployed and depressed, need some guidance","Hi, I want to hear if anyone has any tips or things I can do with my time to help me out of this rut.

I just turned 21, had my whole summer planned out with some friends. We made a whole bucket list of fun things we want to accomplish/do this summer, and I was so excited to have so much free time to do those things. The problem with this part is that most of the things I want to do cost money or require a buddy to do it with, but it seems like my roommates never want to do anything I want to do. I ask every single day if they would like to join me and go out, even just for a walk, and no one ever does. I am going stir crazy and feel like I’m wasting my summer (this is my last summer before I graduate and get a big girl full time job)

On the weekdays, I just sit around at home applying for jobs and then proceed to do nothing while I wait for my boyfriend to get home from work (I don’t like being alone or doing things alone, so I don’t really want to go anywhere). When he gets home he is so beat from work 10-12 hours that he either goes to bed or plays a video game and then goes to bed, so I really only spend time with him on the weekends. Thus, my whole day is basically wasted hoping that the one person who usually undoubtedly gives me the time of day will hangout and talk, but it doesn’t really happen (I get it though, not a relationship problem - we have fun on the weekends together and he’s tired)

Weekends are the only time I actually ever get to do things, but those things usually just consist of getting drunk with my roommates (bad habit, I know).  

Long story short, I just feel like I’m wasting my time and it’s depressing, but the terrible part is that because it’s making me depressed, I don’t even want to do anything anymore. It’s an endless cycle of being bored out of my mind, but also not having the energy to do anything but sit in my bed. Constant mind battle. 

Good news, I have two interviews lined up, except they’re both remote jobs. I know this probably won’t be good for my mental health but I also have only been applying for remote jobs because my anxiety and depression is so bad. I hope that makes sense lol.

882,Why am I so depressed even though good things are happening? (Kind of a long post),"So I’ve been dealing with depression for years, though not medically diagnosed or seen. However, today was the first time I’ve ever felt this depressed. I’ve recently gotten a kitten, which I’ve been wanting to do for years and was stoked the first day. Then the thoughts of whether I was good enough to take care of her and hyper fixating on the everything I do with or for her. Today I went to a concert of a group who’s music I listen to and like, despite not knowing their later songs (which were the main ones being performed) that well. Unlike every other concert I’ve been to, I wasn’t super excited or nervous for this concert (which was already a new feeling for me since concerts are a safe haven to me). It only got worse from there. During the concert, I couldn’t even enjoy myself with all the thoughts coming into my mind (some being about what I’m going to do with my kitten since I still don’t feel like I’m doing enough, despite going above and beyond, and others about not knowing the song that well or the lyrics). Throughout the concert I really tried pushing those thoughts away and tried to fake it until I made by taking videos/pictures, screaming, cheering and singing along with what I knew, but nothing worked. This was the first time that I didn’t feel happy, comfortable and excited at a concert and that really hurts since they’re very important to me and are always one of the few times I feel happy. When I left the concert, my cousins (who are the ones that went with me to the concert) could not contain their smiles and went on and on about how amazing the concert was, which made me even more sad since I didn’t get to experience any of those emotions. So I guess the whole point of this post is to ask why. Why am I so depressed? Why are the things I love not feeling the same anymore? Why is my safe haven, after all these years, being tampered by my depression? (This might not seem that off or important but please take in mind that concerns are really the only place where negative thoughts don’t flood my brain and I where I feel my happiest)",1654576370.0,1,1.0,1,0,v6mitl,t3

887,Here’s some words I’d like to get out.,"Hi guys,
Hope everyone made it through today.
Sorry to bother everyone but I thought it might be a good idea for me to get some words out of my head. I hope it may help me navigate life a little better, and get a clearer picture of the maelstrom of horrors that seems to be my mind of late. If I can see it laid out in words, maybe I’ll see a way out that I haven’t thought of… maybe you guys have some ideas?
Anyways, here we go.
So I’m a 40 year old guy, I have an amazing partner, we have been together about 20 years. We have an amazing 7 year old son.
I have suffered depression, anxiety and PTSD since childhood. I practiced ritual scarification as a child. My first suicide attempt was when I was 15.
Hardly anyone knew my troubles.
My family are nice people, but they seem alien to me, they always have. I would have loved to be close to them, but we never will be, we are too broken now. My dad is a strange man, who’s living ghost haunts us all. He has dementia now, but growing up, living with him was psychological torture.
He was an Irish catholic, to give you an idea.

Anyway, as a child I wanted to be an artist and musician. I was very good. I went and studied at university but dropped out after a few years. I played in rock bands for a few years but never made enough cash. So I got a job.

I’ve been working for nearly 20 years full time. I hate working. I have nothing.
I’d never had enough to get out of the rent cycle and then I got cancer.
I got through the cancer shit but I have no savings.
We got kicked out of our last rental a year ago, and despite stellar references, we couldn’t find a place to live. We had to move in with my wife’s parents and rent there. I live in a caravan in the backyard.

I just keep going, dragging myself to work…. My depression is like a boulder chained to my feet. I cry from the unbearable darkness in my mind and heart most nights. I hide the tears. My mind whispers horrible things to me constantly. I have good patches then crash hard.
Today I crashed so hard, I left work 3 hours early without saying anything… I don’t want to go back, I am burnt out.
I have to go back, my family needs money.
I want to take a break (a long one) try get my head right.
I want to quit.

I dunno. Maybe it's just a readjustment period right now. But seeing everyone I thought was close to me suddenly start shutting me out is really self-deprecating and seems to make whatever advancements I had made with my mental health move backwards.

I feel for her. She showed up at my house yesterday on her lunch break in tears and couldn’t talk, and finally said that she just needed a safe space to land and all she could think about was my house. We sat and talked, and I offered to let her stay the night to be safe. 

The next day we met up and she told me how she appreciated the invite and that it helped her but she’s not 100% ready to leave now which I think makes sense. She has a taste of safety and wants to keep it. 

Do you all think it would be an okay idea to let her ride out the rest of her episode here? I have the room, I don’t mind feeding her and letting her just exist. My partner doesn’t seem to mind the idea either and she is also supportive of my friend. 

My only concern is her getting to comfortable and avoiding the reality that eventually she’ll have to go back home and deal with her husband. Is this something I should let happen or no?",1654573464.0,0,1.0,1,0,v6lo5i,t3

921,I feel so angry and lonely,"Hello everyone, for info I am a 23F, not a student this year because of depression but I will re-enter the educational system next year. English is not my first language, so please be kind with me. Well, here I go.  


I feel so lonely. I feel that every minute that passes I am even more and more lonely. I lost hope, hope that I had when I was first diagnosed with this horrible illness. I was a student last year, and I felt myself falling into the darkness. I reached out for help, and my tutor said that the only way to delay the workload of my last year of studies was to take a gap year. He told me to talk to the university's psychologist, and that's what I did until he let me down because I wasn't a student there anymore. That's when I felt alone for the first time.

&amp;#x200B;

I was soon hospitalized, and the psychiatrist there filed the paperwork to admit me to a free mentalcare center because I couldn't afford going to the psychiatrist and a psychologist. It took months to have my first psychiatrist appointment there, and months later I had my first therapy appointment. My therapist seems to care, but 30 minutes a week (and sometimes she can't even give me an appointment every week) isn't enough for me to say everything that I have in my chest. So far, I have talked about some parts of my childhood but nothing else. I just feel hopeless, and I don't know how she will be able to help me. This will take ages, or maybe I will never recover.  


I know that depression makes us believe we are lonely, and it prevents us from reaching out to others. But believe me, I've tried. I don't have many friends, I just have acquaintances. In fact, I think I don't have friends at all. I thought that friendship would be like it is portrayed in the media : sometimes friends fuck up, sometimes they are sad and need to talk about it, sometimes they fight, etc. I don't have anybody that has asked about it, nobody asks how I feel, how am I doing, nothing, even if my depression is pretty public because I had a breakdown in front of a lot of people this year. For example, just tonight I was talking to somebody I considered as a friend, and when he asked why I never left the house, I answered by saying that sometimes I feel more lonely by being surrounded by groups of people laughing and talking. He didn't even let me finish my sentence, he already was trying to stop me by saying ""OK, OK"".   


I tried to befriend someone that also was diagnosed with depression and is pretty open about it. She dances at the same dance club that I go to. I have tried to invite her to a café, I tried to invite her to the movies just to have fun, but she keeps evading the question (sayign things like ""OK, let's go with the dance club altogether !"" but then nobody wants to go, not even her). This week, I saw her out and about with a friend, and I felt SO jealous. Like, what is wrong with me ? Why doesn't she want to be my friend ? Why does nobody want to be with me ? Why do people keep rejecting me ? I have tried, and tried, and tried to not let me isolate myself but it is SO HARD. I am so jealous of people that have friend groups, or just friends at all. I am so angry at people because they ignore my calls for help, and I feel that the only way to fix this is to suicide. Maybe it even would feel like some type of revenge, because I would leave their minds scarred by my sudden disappearence. And that's what I want, revenge.

923,Depression doesn't look like what most people think it does. Or at least not for me...,"I think what causes a lot of misconceptions/stigma about depression or mental health in general is that people assume the stereotypes are fact, or at least in my opinion, this is the case. 

When I'm pretty depressed and have the confidence to let people know, I think people assume I'm going to be quiet, morose, and overall unapproachable sad case. More often than not (and considering people still approach me.) I appear to come across as approachable. I smile albeit with stunted effort, I try to speak in a positive or helpful tone if asked a question,  and I even chuckle or throw something back when a joke arises, and being in customer service for my job it's pretty much a requirement I pretend to have my shit together for the customers sake.

Obviously though it's all a bit of a mask; on the inside I'm second guessing every word I said in the past 30 minutes, I think about throwing myself out of a window or not moving if a bus came hurtling towards me on the street. And overall I don't want to exist or be in this constant source of pain and turmoil, and I feel it leads people to thinking to themselves ""He's not depressed"" or ""It must not be that bad."" which becomes reflected in their behaviors which usually begins (yet again how I feel) projecting a sense of disbelief and overall lack of caring, which in turn hurts me more.

Basically, my body has no concept of a middle ground and it’s very strange. So basically my body never knows when it needs something until its way too late? If I have to use the bathroom I dont know until I feel like I am going to pee on myself. Same for poop, I don’t know I have to poop until I get very very sick. Same with things like drinking and smoking I dont get high or drunk until I’ve gone a far limit so basically I dont feel anything and then suddenly I am high out of my mind or drunk out of my mind (these are not things I do often, only the occasional times when I go out with friends or am celebrating something) 
Now, these are the physical aspects but I experience the same things with emotions too. There is no middle ground or build up of emotions, I can go from one feeling to the other in an instant without cause or sometimes there can be a cause but it can even be something as small as me dropping a pen and I will absolutely lose my shit and not be able to calm down (that has gotten a little better since im medicated now) but does anyone else get this??? my physicals are all fine in terms of checkups and I cant ask my therapist or psychiatrist anything yet because I dont see them until later this month. I know it is not normal but I just want to see if anyone else experience it and if a health professsional of any kind has ever told you what it means? I cant find it rhrough research online .. so I decided to ask reddit because you guys are all real people with real experiences who may relate",1654567065.0,3,1.0,1,0,v6jnbf,t3

She confessed to me she wanted to die and didn't want to live anymore. I felt like this was a cry for help. She didn't have any sort of plan except ""nothing that involves blood"" 

I took this as crisis mode and called all the help in our circle (therapists, doctors, psychiatrists, etc) and she's started medication, therapy bumped up to twice a week, and we were advised to lock up anything sharp or harmful. 

The problem is, now she is back tracking and says that there's a huge difference between ""wanting to die"" and ""wanting to kill myself"" and i broke her trust and she's never telling me anything again.

I’m also tired of coming home to my mother sitting on her ass after work while I have to come home and can’t sit down until 8pm due to the shit she has me do. And I know that sounds stuck up, but when I say I do everything in the house, I mean EVERYTHING. From dishes to literally folding her underwear. I don’t mind it AT ALL because I know she’s in pain and I want to help as much as I can, but the way I’m treated doesn’t make up for it. She stated today “I get it now. I have to be mean to you in order for you to have common sense”. Nothing I do is good enough. I cleaned the whole fucking house today and she came home and yelled that I didn’t put a cereal box away and I didn’t clean her mess off the table. I don’t pay much to live at home, but I work 40 hours a week, go to school every day, on top of caring for a disabled cat all while trying to battle my own mental issues. I tried telling her once that my mental health has gotten horrible and all she said was “you haven’t mentioned your mental health ONCE. That’s not an excuse”. I have zero motivation. I can’t remember anything. I don’t do anything right. The days are all the same. It’s never any different. I have one singular friend who I’m grateful for. But other than that I’m alone.

I’ve only ever lived 5 years of my life without her. She was my best friend. I have the cat now, but she won’t let me keep him despite him being the reason I bother to come home. Lola my dog was that reason for me coming home. After my cat goes to another home, I’ll be alone. There’s so much more I could go on about. I’m just getting to the point where if I don’t get out soon, I’ll find a permanent solution. Because I have zero purpose here. I have no idea who I am. I have no idea why I’m here.

gonna be real dunno if i have depression (i haven’t been diagnosed, not because i don’t want to be, but no one responded to my requests)

whenever i need to study, i can’t motivate to do worksheets and am so much more inclined to lie down and scroll on my phone

and even when i try to sit down to get work done, when i look at the worksheets, i can’t think of anything (like my brain is numb, fuzzy or something)

i tried moving to other areas to study, but i don’t like going outside and the other places in my house have people in them (and it’s tiring to even move my study materials to different areas—and i don’t feel good leaving them in the living room)

can’t really remember other problems, though i know they’re there. it just gives me a genuine headache to talk about the above already

938,How to cope with over thinking?,"I’m an over thinker - about everything. From life and death to my daily routine, I think about it and the purpose. I find I have to have an answer for everything or it causes me great stress. I don’t deal well with uncertainty, and since life is full of it, I struggle immensely. 

How do you get out of your own head? Is it possible to ever live a “normal” life? I try to change my thought patterns, to notice when my thoughts are negative or leading to nowhere but depression/anxiety, but those thoughts are so prominent it’s hard to keep them at bay. I try to change them to positive thoughts, but I feel like I’m just lying to myself. 

I struggle more because I feel my whole life/persona has become depression and anxiety. Like I have no other personality traits anymore. Everything I do is dictated by my mental health and fear. I just live life afraid at every turn, struggling to enjoy the moment because I worry “what if?”

A lot of my fear is around death and pain, so how funny it is I struggle with feelings of life just not being worth it. I’d never actually do anything, but just the idea alone terrifies me. I’m afraid of going insane or being some closeted psychopath who went undiagnosed.

941,Goodbye,"I really cannot take any of this anymore. I am so done. FYI, I am not posting looking for sympathy, just need to get all of this off my chest. I’ve struggled with mental illness for almost as long as I can remember. I had mental issues before I was even self aware of what they were. I’m only 21 years old, I’ve been diagnosed with severe anxiety and depression, and even worse, depersonalization/derealization disorder and psychosis. For those of you who don’t know what dp/dr is I encourage you to look it up, it is truly a living hell. I feel like a robot 24/7, my surroundings feel so unfamiliar, and I can’t even feel connected to anyone, even my closest family members. My life fucking sucks. I don’t choose to be like this. I wouldn’t wish what I go through upon anyone. I can’t have one second of peace or relief or happiness, even in the best of circumstances. 

It’s funny because if I told some people about this, I think they’d be shocked. Not to sound conceited, but I have a great family, girlfriend of 4 years, a nice car, house, a undergrad and law school scholarship, and have a bright future ahead. But none of this matters to me, no matter how hard I try. 

Idk how much time I have left. Only thing stopping me from ending it right now is probably my mother and gf. But things just seem to be getting so much worse, and I really try to make them better.

I used to feel suicidal, empty and unloveable. But now I have no clear emotion. My family has a history of depression, I had a therapist but my dad fired them. 

I’m a teenager and I should be hanging out with friends, smoking etc but idk, I find no joy or excitement In anything at all. I have no sympathy/empathy wtv, and that has ruined a lot of relationships. I can’t even cry anymore.

I’m in my room all day and night with my cat, taking naps and watching tv (which I don’t even enjoy watching tv) 

I never wanna do anything, I don’t want hobbies because I won’t enjoy them, and I’d just be ruining everyone’s mood.

I feel frustrated..not literally but yk, I don’t/can’t care abt anything. “Most Aquarius’s are that way!” -my aunt, stfu.

I’ve tried to tell my parents how I feel, (this was when I was suicidal and depressed) my dad went on a yelling spree for months. Looking back..what did I do? Be unhappy? Isolate myself? I moved out of his house, his family was pleased to see me go lmao. 

I feel like I upgraded in the depression world lol, like I went from being suicidal, crying, cutting, and now I’m just neutral. I’m trying to find pros for feeling like this.

Pros
-don’t wanna off myself all the time
-not sensitive 
-see things from a non emotional perspective
-hm

Cons
-no friends 
-no hobbies
-nobody cares abt me because of how I act towards people
-social interaction is terrible cause idk how to respond (because I don’t rlly care abt people and can’t sympathize)
-I’m gonna have back problems cause all I do is lay down (laying down rn)
-makes jokes abt how I feel for attention 
-screwed up my relationship with a person I was talking to
-I could go on..but my keyboard is glitching so bad

I don’t care about anyone or anything, I don’t enjoy talking with friends/family, eating, watching tv, ..anything. Idk what to do, apart of me is ok with feeling like this, the other wants to feel normal.

I’m a total wreck. I’ve made far too many mistakes in my life. People are bad. Can’t trust them. I’m waiting to die. Everything I do only serves to distract me from myself until I die. My life has no purpose. I’m easily replaceable. I have no family.  No friends. My parents….. we’re very selfish individuals, only thinking of setting themselves up for the future. I was brought up in an incredibly verbal, physical and mentally abusive family. Which is irrelevant now because it’s the past. And everyone says don’t look back at the past. Only other direction to look is  the one we all make. Death. 

If I’m so insignificant a worthless worm of a man then why do I feel compelled to keep going on with this life? No one cares if I live or die. Random humans don’t emphasize with me in any real sense. I’m all alone and this life of mine is a waste. I have nothing in life to look forward to. I’ll never become anything more insignificant than the “customer service” industry that I’ve grownup in my whole life.

And I just. I don't know man. I had time. A lot of it actually. I probably could have wrap my lessons up and pass this one. Even if I started today, but no instead I really spent the whole day doing nothing. Doom scrolling, playing stupid video games, etc. Just to escape

You know I have a lot of work to do. Passing my finals won't fix my mess of a life. I need a therapist. I need to move out of my parents. I need to find a job. I need to do a lot of crap

But I don't want to. I don't feel like it. I feel like it doesn't matter. But at the same time I know not doing anything only makes me suffer more.

960,Depression after meeting long distance GF,"Not sure if this is the right place to post this but let’s try anyway. I’ve been with my girlfriend for 2 years now, I live in Australia and she lives in the US. We got together in 2020 when I was going thru a rough time in my life, my father is an abusive fuck and my mum passed away years prior. I eventually left home that same year at 16 and luckily was able to get myself a full time job and a nice room in a share house. I would live there for the next year. Fast forward a bit to 2021 our connection grew stronger and stronger, not a day would go by where we didn’t text and call each other. I loved our relationship so much. We had plans of her coming here to visit in 2022 when she finished school but later plans changed so I would end up flying over there to meet her and her family and take her to prom. The months leading up I was terrified she wouldn’t like me in person. So many people had told me it would never work out in person and I was starting to believe it. But I went anyway. 


Turns out I was completely wrong. She was all over me and we couldn’t stop snuggling and kissing each other. I love her even more deeply now and she loves me too. I was there for 2 weeks before I left to go back home. 2 weeks where pretty much we were together 24/7.  

The most depressing thing ever is when her mom was driving us back to the airport. I felt dead inside. The whole timeframe from walking inside that airport to landing back in Australia was hell, I felt so low and felt worse than ever. The days after would be just as bad. Even when I returned to work and got back in my routine it didn’t change. 


Now it’s been almost 3 weeks since I’ve been back and  I don’t feel any better at all, for a few moments a day I will feel happy and excited for our future, then the rest of the day I’ll be plunged into a deep dark place and feel like I’m done with life. She’s literally coming to see me in 3 weeks. Yet I still feel like this. We made a decision that I will move over there for her once visas/green cards are sorted. I don’t know for certain but I feel like my depression isn’t just from missing her, but the overall experience of being over there with her and seeing the country makes me just want to cut to the chase and move today. Which obviously I can’t. I hate my old life here. I used to love it before I left. Now I hate it. Doctors don’t know what’s wrong with me.

i've never had a job. i'm scared i never will. i've tried multiple times but it doesn't work out because it puts me in a worse place mentally. even just going on a day out wipes me out mentally and physically for days after. and as an adult, when people start to ask what i'm doing for a job, what do i say? that i'm too unstable to work? that i don't know whether i'll ever be able to work? i'm exhausted.

973,"I need to help a friend, but I do not know how.","Hi! I have a friend that even though he does not present with MDD, has some traits that worry me. From an outsider's perspective he is a very shiny dude. In fact, he is really enthusiastic in what he does. He is an extremely quick and deep learner. Additionally, he also had such a diverse amount of experiences through his life... like sometimes it seems really unbeliavable. Lol. But the amazing thing is that it's the truth. Well, a great and interesting person to hang out with, but also a super great Friend and an amazing person in general. 

In all of this, you would ask yourself what is the issue. Well, the problem is that since he was around 12 years old, he began having sort of ""ticks"" in which his brain was just misfiring self-mutilation or even suicidal thoughts. The recurrence of the episodes apparently was following a wavy pattern of peaks and throughs but over time the peaks became more frequent than the throughs. These compulsive and almost obsessive thoughts, are really causing so much pain in him although he really manages to mask it up extremely well.  

I suggested him to go to a psychiatrist that could prescribe him some drugs and to follow some CBT. The main problem is that he has no time for these things. We are both students, and our course is really, really demanding therefore we have almost no social life outside our 4 friends group. Theoretically we would be able to make friends, go to parties or visit cities, but literally, we have zero time. Nada. 

Because I am younger than him and went to a demanding course straight after highschool, I never experienced what a easy uni life was. On the other hand though, as mentioned before, this guy had the opportunity to experience so many different things in the years post-highschool and especially pre-Covid. Right now, a normal day for him (and us) is waking up at 8, following lectures until 5, going to the library, coming home at 8, eating something,  quizzing, sleep and repeat. 

Of course such an alienating life style, curved on a desk and staring at a screen for hours on end, is not the greatest thing for our mental health. The problem though is that he began mentioning those annoying thoughts after some months I got to know him. Now 3 years have passed since I met him and I noticed that the frequency of lower moods and these ""tick-like thoughts"" increased and decreased respectively. The fact that he started more often struggling sleeping, has mood changes, problems with gf and being demotivated worries me. 

How does someone get rid of these malicious thoughts? Imagine waking up almost every day for years and thinking about obnoxious self-inflictive things. He luckily does not do that because he is strong and rational enough to resist the urge of these thoughts. I really hope that somehow this trend can be stopped. Do you think that the best decision is to act ASAP and trying some CBT accompanied by some pharmacological help as I suggested? The only problem though is the time. Therefore I am wondering if it is worth doing some intensive CBT during the summer break and the continue it less intensively once the courses restart.

Best of luck to everyone that suffers from a depressive condition or any depressive disorder. It is such a horrible thing and people should be more aware of it, that is why I am asking if someone knows a suggestion for my friend.

975,I wish it wasn't so taboo to talk about suicide,"I used to suffer badly from depression. Except, it wasn't depression as such. It was undiagnosed ADHD and dangerously low iron causing me to be depressed, but in a way that anti-depressants wouldn't help with. Which was annoying, as that was all the doctors would offer. Anyway, the low iron and ADHD eventually (after like 10 years of me asking...) got diagnosed and medicated and for a couple of years everything was looking good. I stopped constantly thinking I'd be better off dead. I got a 'real' job for the first time, moved out on my own, bought a car, all sorts of normal things I'd felt I'd never be capable of. 

And then, I don't know what's happened, but the suicidal thoughts are back. They started coming back when I was on my previous ADHD meds, so I switched to a new type, but now it's even worse. And the problem is I just don't feel like I can explain this openly to my doctor. Just because I constantly think I'd be better off killing myself it doesn't mean I'm going to do it, but it seems other people don't understand that distinction. So if I mention it to them it's gonna go on some sort of a record or, worst case scenario, I get cops breaking down my door. So instead I have to pretend everything is normal. It's so fucking stupid. 

Anyway. I'm failing at my job, everyone else knows I'm failing too but it's the sort of job where it would take ages for them to fire me. I don't like that though, I don't like being there knowing I'm useless and they're stuck with me. But at the same time I feel too shit and self-hating to apply for other jobs, and too poor to be unemployed, so I guess I'm stuck. 

Thing is, I've realised that even when I thought things were okay they weren't really. I have no friends, I just don't understand people and they don't understand me. I'd like friends, but it's just not gonna happen. I have no hobbies, I'm too tired and boring for anything like that. I just don't see the point to any of this. Why am I dragging myself through each day. I mean, I know it's because I don't want to hurt my family, but really why is their hurt any more important than mine.

I feel like I've always been living under the assumption that one day I'll be 'normal', and I'll have a 'normal' life and be like other 'normal' people, but that's never going to be the case. I'm always going to be the strange one, standing on the outskirts of life.",1654554983.0,15,0.97,40,0,v6fodj,t3
976,"Please, just someone, help","Hi, uhm, idk how to start.At the strat,I want to apologize,english isn't my native language,so sorry for grammatic mistakes:So,ok I'm a 14 yo and I've been depressed since a year or so. Before last summer,I was a fairly normal kid,I meaan,I was probably pretty weird and I only had one good friend,but I was ok,I had everything I needed.For sure,I wanted to be a bit cool,and have like ''have the cool clothes'' and not like a caro-patterned       t-shirt but it was fine.

Then,in late spring,I got a pc. It was really cool andI had a lot of fun with it.But then in summer when the holidays started,my parents decided,that I shouldn't bee the whole day on the pc.I...tricked themand still was on the pc,because I needed that online time and I had the oppertunity to do it.But my parents found out and took all of the electric devices I owned .I did't know,what to do but I got them back pretty quickly and...who'd have guessed,I still used them when I shouldn't.And because our neighbour is good with electronics,he tolled them to get an app,where they could set timelimits,that I couldn't just avoid.

It worked,but it send me down a path,I'd have loved to avoid.I don't remember too well and because of that happening all the times,my parents not only don't trust me,but also think I'm doing that on purpose and that I forget things they said just to make them angry,even though I don't.They are angry all the time and make me feel very bad for things,that I can't control.What I can control though,is my productivity and I can tell you,if there's a chance to avoid my chores,I'll take it happily.I do things,that I should do only when theres only very little time left,which is also partly due to my bad memorie.Like for example rn,I have to write an whole 1.5 pages long text for tomorrow and I don't even know,what to do.Don't get me wrong,I feel very bad and sad for all of that and also or especially for my parents but I just can't do it better.The best thing I have ever achieved,is a minigame-time that is in the top 50 for a game with millions of sales.

Back to when the app came though.I then proceeded to watch YouTube the whole day on the switch and play that one game I talked about earlier.It did make me feel better but then,it would be noticed after a couple months and everything was taken again.In this time I felt worse than ever before.I was having suicidal thoughts almost the whole time and I tried self harm.At this time,I should mention,that I don't have any good friends...I think.I really don't know.I can't empathies and I feel like shit and always out of touch.From time to time I'm overeating,then I eat very few things at all.My sleep shedule is also very bad.I go to bed at like two am and have to wake up at six.I had times,where I sleept more than double of that but I was still not feeling better in the slightest.Its also getting worse,bec I now have to put my phone(can't do too much with it anyways because of the app) and my switch to my parts every evening.That really gets me down.Not having that relaxation when when watching YT and forgetting about my life and my problems.

Thats basically where I'm now at: When I'm home I only watch YT and spend very few time with my family.I hope  I die soon but I'm too weak to do it myself.I can't stand up for myself...or rather not for my''real''me.Everyday I'm putting on a mask so everyone thinks I'm ok.Then everyone thinks I'm an agressiv extrovert,when it is the opposite.I also bottle up my feelings and beacause of that I rage pretty quickly,but I can't cry.I haven't cried in almost a year now and my eyes reandomly feel like they are filled up  with tears even though they aren't.I feel tired and numb all the time+ I have social anxiety which makes talking to anyone about regular stuff very hard.Also,I've told nobody how I feel and I often tell myself,that I don't have depression and that I just want something to talk about(even though I won't do that),because I still feel somewhat joy,when I accomplish something,like drawing a picure for fathersday,but I'm never happy with it.I don't want to sound dramatic in any way,but the only thing here for me is somebody who I met online who's also depressiv and who wouldn't know,why I don't answer him,but time to time I feel like,he abandoned ME ,because he doesen't answers within like a week or so.Because I bottle up my emotions,I have times in school,where I just want to kill everybody I don't like (quite a few) and that doesen't happen too rarely (but atleast not too often ether).There are so many things,I still haven't talked about and I won't but thanks you for you're time if you read this text untill now and I hope you're time isn't too hard.",1654554324.0,4,1.0,1,0,v6ffqw,t3

985,"My friend giving up - me, feeling like giving up","I have severe depression I will always have depression but I have found my strength to fight my demons, some days are worse than others.

My friend is on the depression boat too, she’s let herself go and won’t take care of herself and it has shown mentally and physically 

Normally I’m in town to be able to get her to get her to do any self care. 
Im out of town this week 

She doesn’t want to change she doesn’t care to change.
She’s going into a treatment facility but she’s gone to the same one before and it DIDNT work. 
I try to help her and be there for her through my own experiences (I’ve had my fair share of attempts) 
Shes an alcoholic and addicted to anything that will quickly numb the depression.

 (Started ketamine and got addicted which is actually my fault - ketamine helped my depression so I thought maybe it would’ve helped her, we did it together so I could watch her and Dose her correctly, then she got car accident money and bought alot of ketamine behind everyone’s back and was going through a gram a night)

She’s an alcoholic, her dad is a horrible influence and her boyfriend is emotionally abusive and doesn’t help her. 

I’ve been here for her for 3-4 years, bringing her to rehab, listening to her, helping her, doing her dishes getting her to shower, cleaning her whole apartment. Hanging out together, watching out for her. 

Im tired, she hasn’t changed, normally at this point I would be honest and tell someone with her problems that I can’t help anymore since she can’t hear me, and it’s hurting my mental health too, I know if she kills herself everyone in her support group will blame ours selves untill we die.

Im so frustrated I love her and have been trying to help her grow and minimize her depression symptoms 

She’s never self harmed but has had ideas on how she would kill herself 

She’s getting checked into a facility today but I don’t know if it will do anything, I’m so tired of not being heard. Trying to help but always getting shut down. I have my own issues I deal with daily. I still get suicidal thoughts too.",1654547901.0,0,1.0,1,0,v6d1ca,t3
986,Abandonment and Bullying,"My father left me, my mother and my siblings not too long ago and I feel like I'm slipping away.

I am currently in high school and I try to help my best friend who is getting severely bullied for years now.

My mother and siblings think I should just leave her to fend for herself but I can't. A few years ago I was in her situation and hoped that someone would help me but nobody did so I really want to help her to not end up like me.

My mother is depressed and so am I but the while house cares about her a lot and I don't want her to stress too much so I don't say anything.

I mostly feel like everyone is ignoring me or using me so I distance myself from anyone.",1654552573.0,0,1.0,1,0,v6es2h,t3
